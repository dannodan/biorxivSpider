We adapted the FID paradigm to investigate how fast or slow attacking virtual predators constrain escape decisions. We show that rapid escape decisions rely on reactive fear circuits in the periaqueductal gray and midcingulate cortex (MCC), while protracted escape decisions, defined by larger buffer zones, were associated with cognitive fear circuits which include posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, circuits implicated in strategic avoidance and behavioral flexibility. Using a Bayesian Decision Model, we further show that optimization of escape decisions under rapid flight were localized to the MCC, a region involved in adaptive motor control, while the hippocampus is implicated in optimizing decisions that update and control slower escape initiation. These results demonstrate an unexplored link between defensive survival circuits and their role in adaptive escape decisions."},

In order to aid in the development of portable devices used to measure radiation exposure, we constructed a genome-wide screen to detect transcriptional changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes shortly after (approximately 1 hour) radiation exposure at low (0.3 Gy), medium (1.5 Gy) and high (3.0 Gy) doses compared to control (0.0 Gy) using Affymetrix\u00ae Human Gene 1.0 ST v1 microarrays.

We show that several D-type cyclins are consecutively activated in the stomatal linage in the epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. Whereas CYCD2;1 and CYCD3;2 are activated in the meristemoids early in the lineage, CYCD7;1 is activated before the final division. CYCD7;1 expression peaks in the guard mother cell, where its transcription is modulated by the FOUR-LIPS/MYB88 transcription factor. FOUR-LIPS/MYB88 interacts with the CYCD7;1 promoter and represses CYCD7;1 transcription. CYCD7;1 stimulates the final symmetric division in the stomatal lineage, since guard cell formation is delayed in the cycd7;1 mutant epidermis and guard mother cell (GMC) divisions in four-lips mutant guard mother cells are limited by loss of function of CYCD7;1. Hence, the precise activation of a specific D-type cyclin, CYCD7;1, is required for correct timing of the last symmetric division that creates the stomatal guards cells, and CYCD7;1 expression is regulated by the FLP/MYB pathway that ensures cell cycle arrest in the stomatal guard cells."},

Compared to full-length MRs, some vertebrate MRs required higher steroid concentrations to activate GAL4-DBD-MR-hinge/LBD constructs. For example, 11-deoxycortisol activated all full-length vertebrate MRs, but did not activate truncated terrestrial vertebrate MRs and was an agonist for truncated zebrafish MR. Progesterone, 19-norProgesterone and spironolactone did not activate full-length and truncated human, alligator and frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs; at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, while retaining activity for truncated zebrafish MRs, evidence that regulation of progestin activation of chicken MR resides in NTD/DBD and of zebrafish MR in hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser810 in human MR, required for its antagonism by progesterone, suggesting novel regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. Progesterone may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs."}

In order to aid in the development of portable devices used to measure radiation exposure, we constructed a genome-wide screen to detect transcriptional changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes shortly after (approximately 1 hour) radiation exposure at low (0.3 Gy), medium (1.5 Gy) and high (3.0 Gy) doses compared to control (0.0 Gy) using Affymetrix\u00ae Human Gene 1.0 ST v1 microarrays. Our results indicate a number of sensitive and specific transcriptional profiles induced by radiation exposure that can potentially be implemented as biomarkers for radiation exposure as well as dose effect. For overall immediate radiation exposure, KDELC1, MRPS30, RARS, and HEXIM1 were determined to be effective biomarkers while PRDM9, CHST4, and SLC26A10 were determined to be biomarkers specific to 0.3 Gy exposure; RPH, CCDC96, WDYHV1, and IFNA16 were identified for 1.5 Gy exposure; and CWC15, CHCHD7, and DNAAF2 were determined to be sensitive and specific to 3.0 Gy exposure.

We use aversive reinforcement to train experimenter zebra finches to discriminate between auditory stimuli in the presence of an observer finch. We find that experimenters are slow to successfully discriminate the stimuli but immediately generalize their ability to a new set of similar stimuli. By contrast, observers subjected to the same task instantly discriminate the initial stimulus set, but requiremore time for successful generalization. Drawing upon machine learning insights, we suggest that observer learning has evolved to rapidly absorb sensory statistics without pressure to minimize neural resources, whereas learning from experience is endowed with a form of regularization that enables robust inference."},

Using a Bayesian Decision Model, we further show that optimization of escape decisions under rapid flight were localized to the MCC, a region involved in adaptive motor control, while the hippocampus is implicated in optimizing decisions that update and control slower escape initiation.

In this study, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the distribution of body fat to the arms, legs and trunk. Proportions of fat, distributed to the different compartments, were calculated for 362,499 individuals from the UK biobank, based on segmental bioimpedance analysis (sBIA) estimates. A total of 85 body fat distribution loci were identified, using data from 116,138 participants, and replicated in an independent set of participants (N = 246,361). Out of these loci, 28 were associated with the proportion of fat in the arms, 43 with the legs and 57 with the trunk. A large degree of overlap was observed between legs and trunk loci (N=33), while arm loci overlapped to a smaller degree with leg and trunk loci (N=4 and 6, respectively). As many as 50 of the loci have not previously been associated with any adiposity-related trait. Within the novel loci we found lipid metabolism-related genes such as CILP2 and OSBPL7, as well as androgen receptor function-related genes such as ESR1, ID4 and ADAMTS17. Significant interactions between the top SNP and sex were observed for 38 loci. Our findings provide evidence for multiple loci that affect the distribution of body fat to discrete compartments of the human body, and highlight that genetic effects differ between men and women, in particular for distribution of body fat to the legs and trunk."},

We found that while scene categorization behavior is best explained by a functional feature space reflecting potential actions in scenes, cortical responses in scene-selective areas are best explained by mid- and high-level layers of computational deep neural network models (DNNs). While other regions of extrastriate cortex represented some functional features, our findings reveal a striking dissociation of functional versus DNN features in their contribution to scene categorization and brain responses, indicating that scene-selective cortex and DNNs represent only a subset of behaviorally relevant scene information."},

Compared to full-length MRs, some vertebrate MRs required higher steroid concentrations to activate GAL4-DBD-MR-hinge/LBD constructs. For example, 11-deoxycortisol activated all full-length vertebrate MRs, but did not activate truncated terrestrial vertebrate MRs and was an agonist for truncated zebrafish MR. Progesterone, 19-norProgesterone and spironolactone did not activate full-length and truncated human, alligator and frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs; at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, while retaining activity for truncated zebrafish MRs, evidence that regulation of progestin activation of chicken MR resides in NTD/DBD and of zebrafish MR in hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser810 in human MR, required for its antagonism by progesterone, suggesting novel regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. Progesterone may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs."},

The zebrafish is an excellent system for studying this morphogenetically active tissue. The external yolk syncytial nuclei (e-YSN) undergo microtubule dependent epiboly movements that distribute the nuclei over the yolk. How e-YSN epiboly proceeds, and what role the yolk microtubule network plays is not understood but currently it is proposed that e-YSN are pulled vegetally as the microtubule network shortens from the vegetal pole. Data from our live imaging studies suggest that the yolk microtubule network is dismantled from the animal and vegetal regions and show that a region of stabilized microtubules forms before nuclear migration begins. e-YSN do not appear to be pulled vegetally but rather move along a dynamic microtubule network. We also show that overexpression of the KASH domain of Syne2a impairs e-YSN movement, implicating the LINC complex in e-YSN migration. This work provides new insights into the role of microtubules in morphogenesis of an extraembryonic tissue."},

Although several molecular mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance are well studied, a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of resistant subpopulations within a heterogeneous tumor cell population remains elusive.  While mathematical models describing the dynamics of heterogeneous cancer cell populations have been proposed, few have been experimentally validated due to the complex nature of resistance that limits the ability of a single phenotypic marker to sufficiently isolate drug resistant subpopulations.  In this work, we address this problem with a combined experimental and modeling system that uses drug sensitivity data to reveal the composition of multiple subpopulations differing in their level of drug resistance. We calibrate time-resolved dose-response data to three mathematical models to interrogate the models ability to capture the dynamics of drug.  All three models demonstrated an increase in population level resistance following drug exposure. The candidate models were compared by Akaike information criterion and the model selection criteria identified a multi-state model incorporating the role of population heterogeneity and cellular plasticity.  To validate the ability of this model to identify the composition of subpopulations, we mixed wild-type MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR resistant cells at various proportions and evaluated the corresponding model output.  Our blinded two-state model was able to estimate the proportions of cell subtypes, with the measured proportions falling within the 95 percent confidence intervals on the parameter estimations and at an R-squared value of 0.986. To the best of our knowledge, this contribution represents the first work to combine experimental time-resolved drug sensitivity data with a mathematical model of resistance development."},

Critically, the functional relationship between co-activated cortical systems is unclear: Co-activations may reflect the interactive coupling between information-linked cortical systems or merely parallel but independent sensory processing. Here, we report causal evidence that human somatosensory cortex (S1), which co-activates with auditory cortex during the processing of vibrations and textures, interactively couples to cortical systems that support auditory perception. Acute manipulation of S1 activity using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) impairs auditory frequency perception when subjects simultaneously attend to auditory and tactile frequency, but not when attention is directed to audition alone. Auditory frequency perception is unaffected by TMS over visual cortex thus confirming the privileged coupling between the somatosensory and auditory cortical systems in temporal frequency processing. Our results provide a key demonstration that selective attention can enhance the functional coupling between cortical systems that support different sensory modalities. The gating of crossmodal coupling by selective attention may critically support multisensory interactions and feature-specific perception."},

However, it is rather sensitive to borrowing events, coding errors, semantic shift and other anomalies, so other models, in particular the covarion model, tends to have a better fit to the data. Here, we introduce the pseudo Dollo model, a model of character evolution along a tree that can be formulated as a three-state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model. The initial state represent absence of a feature, then a birth event allows the feature to be present. A death event can follow so that the feature becomes absent again. However, no new birth events are allowed after a death event has taken place. We examine the model in a fully Bayesian setting, and demonstrate it can have a better fit than some of the popular alternative models on some real world datasets. Some variations on the pseudo Dollo model are introduced as well, including the multi-state pseudo Dollo model and pseudo Dollo covarion model. The model is implemented in open source software Babel, a package to BEAST licensed under LGPL.

Feather structure is known to vary among individuals, and it has been suggested that populations exposed to different environmental conditions may exhibit different patterns in feather structure. We examined both down and contour feathers from two populations of male Torrent Ducks (Merganetta armata) from Lima, Peru, one highland population from the Chancay-Huaral River at approximately 3500 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.) and one lowland population from the Chill&oacuten River at approximately 1500 m.a.s.l.. Down feather structure differed significantly between the two populations. Ducks from the highland population had longer, denser down compared with lowland individuals. Contour feather structure varied greatly between individuals but showed no significant difference between populations. These results suggest that the innermost, insulative layer of plumage (the down), may respond to lower ambient temperatures in higher elevations. The lack of observable differences in the contour feathers may be due to the general constraints of the waterproof capability of this outer plumage layer."},

How the circadian clock interweaves with tissue-specific transcriptional programs is poorly understood. Here we dissected temporal and tissue-specific regulation at multiple gene regulatory layers by examining mouse tissues with an intact or disrupted clock over time. Integrated analysis uncovered two distinct regulatory modes underlying tissue-specific rhythms: tissue-specific oscillations in transcription factor (TF) activity, which were linked to feeding-fasting cycles in liver and sodium homeostasis in kidney; and co-localized binding of clock and tissue-specific transcription factors at distal enhancers. Chromosome conformation capture (4C-Seq) in liver and kidney identified liver-specific chromatin loops that recruited clock-bound enhancers to promoters to regulate liver-specific transcriptional rhythms. Furthermore, this looping was remarkably promoter-specific on the scale of less than ten kilobases. Enhancers can contact a rhythmic promoter while looping out nearby nonrhythmic alternative promoters, confining rhythmic enhancer activity to specific promoters. These findings suggest that chromatin folding enables the clock to regulate rhythmic transcription of specific promoters to output temporal transcriptional programs tailored to different tissues."},

This drawback was exacerbated until recently by lack of physiopathologically meaningful human experimental systems that link epidemiological data with results from model organisms. We developed a novel approach, integrating epidemiological with experimental evidence. Starting from 1,874 mother-child pairs we identified mixtures of chemicals, measured during early pregnancy, associated with language delay or low-birth weight in offspring. These mixtures were then tested on multiple complementary in vitro and in vivo models. We demonstrate that each EDC mixture, at levels found in pregnant women, disrupts hormone-regulated and disease-relevant gene regulatory networks at both the cellular and organismal scale."},

The histone code is complex and consists of more than 100 marks. Therefore, biologists need computational tools to characterize general signatures representing the distributions of tens of chromatin marks around thousands of regions. To this end, we developed a software tool called HebbPlot, which utilizes a Hebb neural network in learning a general chromatin signature from regions with a common function. Hebb networks can learn the associations between tens of marks and thousands of regions. This is the first application of Hebb networks in the epigenetics field. HebbPlot presents a signature as a digitized image, in which a bright pixel indicates the presence of a mark around a part of the genetic element, and a black pixel indicates the absence of the mark. A row of pixels represents one mark. Similar rows are clustered in the image. We validated HebbPlot on synthetic data and on 111 epigenomes provided by the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. HebbPlot was able to retrieve distinct chromatin signatures for promoters, enhancers, and genes active in each of the 111 cell types. Our analysis reveals that active promoters have a directional signature; marks such as H3K79(me1/me2), H3K4(me1,me2,me3), and H3K9ac stretch toward coding regions. The plots of inactive promoters show that H3K27me3 is consistently present around them. Further, the signatures of enhancers that are fully included in repetitive regions are almost identical to those located outside repeats, indicating that transposons have an enhancer-like function in the human genome. Furthermore, the chromatin signature of active elements consists of the presence of H3K79me1 and the absence of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. In sum, HebbPlot is a general tool that can be applied to wide array of studies, facilitating the deciphering of the histone code."},

Csde1 is an RNA-binding protein required for erythropoiesis and strongly upregulated in erythroblasts relative to other hematopoietic progenitors. The aim of this study is to identify the Csde1-containing protein complexes, and investigate their role in regulating the translation of Csde1-bound transcripts. We show that Strap, also called Unrip, was the protein most strongly associated with Csde1 in erythroblasts. Strap is a WD40 protein involved in signaling and RNA splicing, but its role is unknown when associated with Csde1. Reduced expression of Strap did not alter the pool of transcripts bound by Csde1. Instead, it reduced the mRNA and/or protein expression of several Csde1-bound transcript, that encode for proteins essential for translational regulation during hypoxia, such as Hmbs, eIF4g3 and Pabpc4. Also affected by Strap knockdown were Vim, a Gata-1 target crucial for erythrocyte enucleation, and Elavl1, which stabilizes Gata-1 mRNA. Thus, we found that the Csde1/Strap complex is at the crossroad of multiple pathways governing translation in erythroblasts."},

The reactivation of specific neural activity patterns (replay) during sleep has been observed in both structures and is hypothesized to represent a neuronal substrate of consolidation. In the hippocampus, replay happens during sharp wave-ripples (SWR), short bouts of excitatory activity in area CA3 which induce high frequency oscillations in area CA1. In particular, recordings of hippocampal cells which spike at a specific location (place cells) show that recently learned trajectories are reactivated during SWR in the following sleep SWR. Despite the importance of sleep replay, its underlying neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. We developed a model of SWR activity, to study the effects of learning-induced synaptic changes on spontaneous sequence reactivation during SWR. The model implemented a paradigm including three epochs: Pre-sleep, learning and Post-sleep activity. We first tested the effects of learning on the hippocampal network activity through changes in a minimal number of synapses connecting selected pyramidal cells. We then introduced an explicit trajectory-learning task to the model, to obtain behavior-induced synaptic changes. The model revealed that the recently learned trajectory reactivates during sleep more often than other trajectories in the training field. The study predicts that the gain of reactivation rate during sleep following vs sleep preceding learning for a trained sequence of pyramidal cells depends on Pre-sleep activation of the same sequence, and on the amount of trajectory repetitions included in the training phase."},

Here, we use the experimental evidence supporting the interaction between proteins, in conjunction with the so-called disparity filter, to construct a reliable and unbiased proteome-scale human interactome.

The well-defined composition of fondaparinux allowed us to perform docking simulations, which showed two clusters of fondaparinux binding: the V3 loop, and a domain consisting of the N- and C-termini. Together, the experimental and theoretical results indicate the heparin/heparan sulfate binding sites on JR-FL gp120 and the efficient interaction of fondaparinux, a widely exploited therapeutic carbohydrate, on gp120."},

In wetlands in particular, dissolved organic matter (DOM) may influence methylmercury (MeHg) production both through chemical interactions and through substrate effects on microbiomes. We conducted microcosm experiments in two disparate wetland environments (oligotrophic unvegetated and high-C vegetated sediments) to examine the impacts of plant leachate and inorganic mercury loadings (20 mg/L HgCl2) on microbiomes, DOM cycling, and MeHg production in the St. Louis River Estuary. Our research reveals the greater relative capacity for mercury methylation in vegetated over unvegetated sediments. Further, our work shows how mercury cycling in oligotrophic unvegetated sediments may be susceptible to DOM inputs in the St. Louis River Estuary: microcosms receiving leachate produced substantially more MeHg than unamended microcosms. We also demonstrate (1) changes in microbiome structure towards Clostridia, (2) metagenomic shifts toward fermentation, and (3) degradation of complex DOM; all of which coincide with elevated net MeHg production in unvegetated microcosms receiving leachate. Finally, we examine microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as known potential methylators and identify important organisms for future research in the Great Lakes region. Together, our work shows the influence of wetland vegetation in controlling MeHg production in the Great Lakes region and provides evidence that this may be due to both enhanced microbial activity as well as differences in microbiome composition."},

The weak evidence provided by P values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks.  \nWhen you observe P = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3:1. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the P value.  And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5 %, you would have to assume that you were 87% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done.\nIf you observe P = 0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 100:1 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive, But the false positive risk would still be 8% if the prior probability of a real effect was only 0.1.  And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5% you would need to observe P = 0.00045.\nIt is recommended that the terms \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cnon-significant\u201d should never be used. Rather, P values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk.

Symbiodinium community composition within the coral host has been shown to influence a coral's ability to resist and recover from stress. A multitude of stressors including ocean warming, ocean acidification, and eutrophication have been linked to global scale decline in coral health and cover in recent decades. Three distinct thermal regimes (highTP, modTP, and lowTP) following an inshore-offshore gradient of declining average temperatures and thermal variation were identified on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). Quantitative metabarcoding of the ITS-2 locus was employed to investigate differences and similarities in Symbiodinium genetic diversity of the Caribbean corals Siderastrea siderea, S. radians, and Pseudodiploria strigosa between the three thermal regimes. A total of ten Symbiodinium lineages were identified across the three coral host species. Siderastrea siderea associated with distinct Symbiodinium communities, however Symbiodinium communities of its congener, S. radians, and P. strigosa, were more similar to one another. Thermal regime played a role in defining Symbiodinium communities in S. siderea but not S. radians or P. strigosa. Against expectations, Symbiodinium trenchii, a symbiont known to confer thermal tolerance, was dominant only in S. siderea at one sampled offshore site and was rare inshore, suggesting that coral thermal tolerance in more thermally variable inshore habitats is achieved through alternative mechanisms. Overall, thermal parameters alone were likely not the only primary drivers of Symbiodinium community composition, suggesting that environmental variables unrelated to temperature (i.e., light availability, or nutrients) may play key roles in structuring coral-algal communities in Belize and that the relative importance of these environmental variables may vary by coral host species."},

Additionally, these trials are becoming increasingly complex, often having multiple arms and many genomic eligibility criteria. Currently, it is a challenging for physicians to match patients to relevant clinical trials using the patient's genomic profile, which can lead to missed opportunities. Automated matching against uniformly structured and encoded genomic eligibility criteria is essential to keep pace with the complex landscape of precision medicine clinical trials.  Results: To meet these needs, we built and deployed an automated clinical trial matching platform called MatchMiner at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The platform has been integrated with Profile, DFCI's enterprise genomic profiling project, which contains tumor profile data for >20,000 patients, and has been made available to physicians across the Institute. As no current standard exists for encoding clinical trial eligibility criteria, a new language called Clinical Trial Markup Language (CTML) was developed, and over 178 genomically-driven clinical trials were encoded using this language. The platform is open source and freely available for adoption by other institutions.  Conclusion: MatchMiner is the first open platform developed to enable computational matching of patient-specific genomic profiles to precision cancer medicine clinical trials. Creating MatchMiner required developing clinical trial eligibility standards to support genome-driven matching and developing intuitive interfaces to support practical use-cases. Given the complexity of tumor profiling and the rapidly changing multi-site nature of genome-driven clinical trials, open source software is the most efficient, scalable, and economical option for matching cancer patients to clinical trials."},

Currently, we have a limited understanding of how geometrical properties of microtubule arrays, in turn, regulate the output of crosslinking proteins. Here we investigate this problem in the context of microtubule sliding by two interacting proteins: the non-motor crosslinker PRC1 and the kinesin Kif4A. The collective activity of PRC1 and Kif4A also results in their accumulation at microtubule plus-ends (\u2018end-tag\u2019). Sliding stalls when the end-tags on antiparallel microtubules collide, forming a stable overlap. Interestingly, we find that structural properties of the initial array regulate PRC1-Kif4A mediated microtubule organization. First, sliding velocity scales with initial microtubule-overlap length. Second, the width of the final overlap scales with microtubule lengths. Our analyses reveal how micron-scale geometrical features of antiparallel microtubules can regulate the activity of nanometer-sized proteins to define the structure and mechanics of microtubule-based architectures."},

The purpose of this study was to characterize these morphs and determine if they are genetically distinct species in order to assess whether alternative management strategies should be employed to control these populations. We sequenced two chloroplast regions, RbcL and MatK, and one nuclear region, ITS2, from the purple morphs and green-yellow morphs collected from Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, MI, USA. Sequences were aligned with reference G. paniculata and G. elegans sequences obtained from GenBank and the Barcode of Life (BOLD) databases. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the two color morphs belong to G. paniculata and do not appear to be distinct genetic strains. We propose that current management practices continue to treat the two color morphs in a similar manner in terms of removal to prevent the further spread of this species."},

They form multiple protein complexes of which two kinds, PRC1 and PRC2, are indispensable for repression. Although much is known about their biochemical properties, how PRC1 and PRC2 are targeted to specific genes is poorly understood. Here we establish the Cyclin D2 (CCND2) oncogene as a simple model to address this question. We provide the evidence that coordinated recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes to CCND2 involves a combination of a specialized PRC1 targeting element (PTE) and an adjacent CpG-island, which together act as a human Polycomb Response Element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of CCND2 in different transcriptional states indicates that histone modifications produced by PRC1 and PRC2 are not sufficient to recruit either of the complexes. However, catalytic activity of PRC2 helps to anchor PRC1 at the PTE. Our analyses suggest that coordinated targeting of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes by juxtaposed AT-rich PTEs and CpG-islands may be a general feature of Polycomb repression in mammals."},

However, critical information regarding the evidence of clinical utility of such anomalies is largely buried in biomedical literature.

In an effort to improve and speed up the process of manually reviewing and extracting relevant information from literature, we have developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based text mining (TM) system called eGARD (extracting Genomic Anomalies association with Response to Drugs). This system relies on the syntactic nature of sentences coupled with various textual features to extract relations between genomic anomalies and drug response from MEDLINE abstracts.  Our system achieved high precision, recall and F-measure of up to 0.95, 0.86 and 0.90, respectively, on annotated evaluation datasets created in-house and obtained externally from PharmGKB. Additionally, the system extracted information that helps determine the confidence level of extraction to support prioritization of curation.

The metabolic pathways that produce SMs are found in contiguous gene clusters in fungal genomes, an atypical arrangement for metabolic pathways in other eukaryotes. Comparative studies of filamentous fungal species have shown that SM gene clusters are often either highly divergent or uniquely present in one or a handful of species, hampering efforts to determine the genetic basis and evolutionary drivers of SM gene cluster divergence. Here we examined SM variation in 66 cosmopolitan strains of a single species, the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Investigation of genome-wide within-species variation revealed five general types of variation in SM gene clusters: non-functional gene polymorphisms, gene gain and loss polymorphisms, whole cluster gain and loss polymorphisms, allelic polymorphisms where different alleles corresponded to distinct, non-homologous clusters, and location polymorphisms in which a cluster was found to differ in its genomic location across strains. These polymorphisms affect the function of representative A. fumigatus SM gene clusters, such as those involved in the production of gliotoxin, fumigaclavine, and helvolic acid, as well as the function of clusters with undefined products. In addition to enabling the identification of polymorphisms whose detection requires extensive genome-wide synteny conservation (e.g., mobile gene clusters and non-homologous cluster alleles), our approach also implicated multiple underlying genetic drivers, including point mutations, recombination, genomic deletion and insertion events, as well as horizontal gene transfer from distant fungi. Finally, most of the variants that we uncover within A. fumigatus have been previously hypothesized to contribute to SM gene cluster diversity across entire fungal classes and phyla. We suggest that the drivers of genetic diversity operating within a fungal species shown here are sufficient to explain SM cluster macroevolutionary patterns."},

Methods: We created and validated a 42-item Rockwood-based FI in The Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (n=1477; 623 men, 854 women; aged 29-95 years) and analyzed its association with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in up to 30-years of follow-up. Deaths due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, dementia and other causes were considered as competing risks.  Results: Our FI demonstrated construct validity as its associations with age, sex and mortality were similar to the existing literature.

A bimodal relationship has been proposed, where delirium is particularly adverse for those with underlying frailty, but may have a smaller effect (perhaps even protective) if it is an early indicator of acute illness in fitter people. We investigated the impact of delirium on mortality in a cohort simultaneously evaluated for frailty.  Methods:\nWe undertook an exploratory analysis of a cohort of consecutive acute medical admissions aged \u226570. Delirium on admission was ascertained by psychiatrists. A Frailty Index (FI) was derived according to a standard approach. Deaths were notified from linked national mortality statistics. Cox regression was used to estimate associations between delirium, frailty and their interactions on mortality.  Results: The sample consisted of 710 individuals.

However, this concept remains largely untested, and just a handful of RIDLs have been identified. We present a transcriptome-wide map of putative RIDLs in human, using evidence from insertion frequency, strand bias and evolutionary conservation of sequence and structure. In the exons of GENCODE v21 lncRNAs, we identify 5374 RIDLs in 3566 loci. These are enriched in functionally-validated and disease-associated genes. This RIDL map was used to explore the relationship between TEs and lncRNA subcellular localisation. Using global localisation data from ten human cell lines, we uncover a dose-dependent relationship between nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution, and exonic LINE2 and MIR elements. This is observed in multiple cell types, and is unaffected by confounders of transcript length or expression. Experimental validation with engineered transgenes shows that L2b, MIRb and MIRc elements drive nuclear enrichment of their host lncRNA. Together these data suggest a global role for exonic TEs in regulating the subcellular localisation of lncRNAs."},

ASIC proteins can form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels. The ASIC3 subunit has been shown to be of particular importance in the peripheral nervous system with pharmacological and genetic manipulations demonstrating a role in pain. Naked mole-rats, despite having functional ASICs, are insensitive to acid as a noxious stimulus and show diminished avoidance of acidic fumes, ammonia and carbon dioxide. Here we cloned naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3) and used a cell surface biotinylation assay to demonstrate that it traffics to the plasma membrane, but using whole-cell patch-lamp electrophysiology we observed that nmrASIC3 is insensitive to both protons and the non-proton ASIC3 agonist 2-Guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ). However, in line with previous reports of ASIC3 mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we found that the ASIC3 antagonist APETx2 reversibly inhibits ASIC-like currents in naked mole-rat DRG neurons. We further show that like the proton-insensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 forms functional, proton sensitive heteromers with other ASIC subunits. An amino acid alignment of ASIC3s between 9 relevant rodent species and human identified unique sequence differences that might underlie the proton insensitivity of nmrASIC3. However, introducing nmrASIC3 differences into rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) produced only minor differences in channel function, and replacing nmrASIC3 sequence with that of rASIC3 did not produce a proton-sensitive ion channel.

Obtaining, using, and disposing of uranyl acetate is getting increasingly cumbersome in many countries due to new regulations on the handling of radioactive substances. Therefore, we developed an alternative staining procedure that does not rely on the use of uranium or any other radioactive substance. This procedure provides excellent contrast and efficiently reduces specimen charging."},

As a phenotype, risk-taking behaviour therefore fits within a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, whereby identifying genetic determinants of this trait has the potential to improve our understanding across different psychiatric disorders. Here we report a genome wide association study in 116 255 UK Biobank participants who responded yes/no to the question: Would you consider yourself a risk-taker? Risk-takers (compared to controls) were more likely to be men, smokers and have a history of psychiatric disorder. Genetic loci associated with risk-taking behaviour were identified on chromosomes 3 (rs13084531) and 6 (rs9379971). The effects of both lead SNPs were comparable between men and women. The chromosome 3 locus highlights CADM2, previously implicated in cognitive and executive functions, but the chromosome 6 locus is challenging to interpret due to the complexity of the HLA region. Risk-taking behaviour shared significant genetic risk with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as with smoking and total obesity. Despite being based on only a single question, this study furthers our understanding of the biology of risk-taking behaviour, a trait which has a major impact on a range of common physical and mental health disorders."},

Compared to wild-type BRAF (BRAFWT) disease, stage II/III CC patients with BRAF mutant (BRAFMT) tumors have shorter overall survival after relapse; however, time-to-relapse is not significantly different. The aim of this investigation was to identify, and validate, novel predictors of relapse of stage II/III BRAFMT CC. \nPatients and methods: We used gene expression data from a cohort of 460 patients (GSE39582) to perform a supervised classification analysis based on risk-of-relapse within BRAFMT stage II/III CC, to identify transcriptomic biomarkers associated with prognosis within this genotype. These findings were validated using immunohistochemistry in an independent population-based cohort of Stage II/III CC (n=691), applying Cox proportional hazards analysis to determine associations with survival. \nResults: High gene expression levels of Bcl-xL, a key regulator of apoptosis, were associated with increased risk of relapse, specifically in BRAFMT tumors (HR=8.3, 95% CI 1.7-41.7), but not KRASMT/BRAFWT or KRASWT/BRAFWT tumors. High Bcl-xL protein expression in BRAFMT, untreated, stage II/III CC was confirmed to be associated with an increased risk of death in an independent cohort (HR=12.13, 95% CI 2.49-59.13). Additionally, BRAFMT tumors with high levels of Bcl-xL protein expression appeared to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (P for interaction =0.006), indicating the potential predictive value of Bcl-xL expression in this setting. \nConclusions: These findings provide evidence that Bcl-xL gene and/or protein expression identifies a poor prognostic subgroup of BRAFMT stage II/III CC patients, who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy."},

Here we asked whether a non-primate lentivirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), also forms such RNA-granule-derived intracellular capsid assembly intermediates. First, we found that, unlike for HIV-1, the FIV completed immature capsid and the largest putative assembly intermediate are unstable during analysis. Next, we identified in situ cross-linking conditions that overcame this problem and revealed the presence of FIV Gag complexes that correspond in size to early and late HIV-1 assembly intermediates. Because assembly-defective HIV-1 Gag mutants are arrested at specific intracellular assembly intermediates, we asked if a similar arrest is also observed for FIV. We analyzed four FIV Gag mutants, including three not previously studied that we identified based on sequence and structural similarity to HIV-1 Gag, and found that each is assembly-defective and arrested at the same intermediate as the corresponding HIV-1 mutant. Further evidence that these FIV Gag-containing complexes correspond to assembly intermediates came from co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrating that FIV Gag is associated with ABCE1 and DDX6, as shown previously for HIV-1. Finally, we validated these co-immunoprecipitations with a proximity ligation assay that revealed co-localization between assembly-competent FIV Gag and ABCE1 in situ. Together, these data offer novel structure-function insights and indicate that primate and non-primate lentiviruses form intracellular capsid assembly intermediates derived from ABCE1-containing RNA granules."},

Specifically, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the feature map sets extracted from the tertiary protein structures. Each feature map set represents particular biochemical properties associated with the atomic coordinates appearing on the outer surface of protein's three dimensional structure. The experimental results on the collected dataset for classifying TSGs and OGs demonstrate promising performance with 82.57% accuracy and 0.89 area under the ROC curve.

They have various applications ranging from the study of isotope circulation in the main earth systems to the determination of the provenance of migratory animals. Isoscapes can be produced from the fit of statistical models to observations originating from a set of discrete locations. Mixed models are powerful tools for drawing inferences from correlated data. While they are widely used to study non-spatial variation, they are often overlooked in spatial analyses. In particular, they have not been used to study the spatial variation of isotope composition. Here, we introduce this statistical framework and illustrate the methodology by building isoscapes of the isotope composition of hydrogen  for precipitation water in Europe. For this example, the approach based on mixed models presents a higher predictive power than a widespread alternative approach. We discuss other advantages offered by mixed models including: the ability to model the residual variance in isotope composition, the quantification of prediction uncertainty, and the simplicity of model comparison and selection using an adequate information criterion: the conditional AIC (cAIC). We provide all source code required for the replication of the results of this paper as a small R package to foster a transparent comparison between alternative frameworks used to model isoscapes."},

We selected four exceptionally long-lived mutants and three examples of the most successful life-extending RNAi treatments (which increased mean lifespan by 35% rather than 120% as reported). We used the dataset augmented with publicly available gene expression datasets to produce a transcriptomic signature of biological age. We introduced a transcriptomic measure of biological age and observed that its dependence on chronological age is modulated by a single parameter, the rate of aging. \nWe hypothesized that the scaling revealed in the gene expression kinetics underlies the recently observed scaling of the survival curves in C.elegans, and the stochasticity in gene expressions leads to deceleration of mortality with age, reaching a plateau at advanced ages. Using experimental survival data, we confirm that the plateau mortality agrees closely with the estimate of Gompertz exponent at the cross-over age near the mean lifespan. The genes associated with aging in our data are enriched with the targets of transcription factors such as DAF-16, ELT-2, ELT-6, NHR-10, ZTF-9, NHR-86, and miRNAs including miR-57, -59,  and -244, which is in  agreement with  previous studies. Overall, our meta-analysis results are consistent with a concept of aging based on critical dynamics of molecular level variables (e.g., gene expression), and support our view of aging as arising from dynamic instability of a single (critical) mode."},

Dense recurrent connectivity in local cortical circuits can lead to counterintuitive response properties, raising the question of whether there are simple arithmetical rules for relating circuits' connectivity structure to their  response properties.  One such arithmetic is provided by the mean field theory of balanced networks, which is derived in a limit where excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents precisely balance on average.  However, balanced network theory is not applicable to some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that cortical circuits with such structure are susceptible to an amplification mechanism arising when excitatory-inhibitory balance is broken at the level of local subpopulations, but maintained at a global level. This amplification, which can be quantified by a linear correction to the classical mean field theory of balanced networks, explains several response properties observed in cortical recordings."},

Here we develop a novel multiplexed assay to study promoter function in E. coli by building a site-specific genomic recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) system that allows for the facile construction and testing of large libraries of genetic designs integrated into precise genomic locations. We build and test a library of 10,860 \u03c370 promoter variants consisting of all combinations of a set of eight -35 elements, eight -10 elements, three UP elements, eight spacers, and eight backgrounds. We find that the -35 and -10 sequence elements can explain approximately 73% of the variance in promoter strength using a simple log-linear model. Using a simple neural network, we can build models that explain greater than 95% of the variance, and show the increased power is due to nonlinear interactions of the other elements such as the spacer, background, and UP elements."},

Science is traditionally founded on theories and models, most often formalized with mathematical formulas handcrafted by theoretical scientists and refined through experiments. Machine learning, an important branch of modern Artificial Intelligence, focuses on learning from data. This leads to a fundamentally different approach to model-building: we step back and focus on the design of algorithms capable of building models from data, but the models themselves are not designed by humans. This is even more true with deep learning, which requires little engineering by hand and is responsible for many of Artificial Intelligence's spectacular successes. In contrast to logic systems, knowledge from a deep learning model is difficult to understand, reuse, and may involve up to a billion parameters. On the other hand, probabilistic machine learning techniques such as deep learning offer an opportunity to tackle large complex problems that are out of the reach of traditional theory-making. It is possible that the more intuition-like reasoning performed by deep learning systems is mostly incompatible with the logic formalism of mathematics. Yet recent studies have shown that deep learning can be useful to logic systems and vice versa. Success at unifying different paradigms of Artificial Intelligence from logic to probability theory offers unique opportunities to combine data-driven approaches with traditional theories. These advancements are susceptible to impact significantly biological sciences, where dimensionality is high and limit the investigation of traditional theories."},

Observed spectral features (peaks) that are not isotopologues do not directly correspond to known compounds and cannot be placed into existing metabolic networks. Spectral artifacts account for many of these unidentified peaks, and misassignments made to these artifact peaks can create large interpretative errors. Without accurate identification of artifactual features and correct assignment of real features, discerning their roles within living systems is effectively impossible. We have observed three types of artifacts unique to FTMS that often result in regions of abnormally high peak density (HPD) which we collectively refer to as HPD artifacts: i) fuzzy sites representing small regions of m/z space with a \"fuzzy\" appearance due to the extremely high number of peaks present; ii) ringing due to a very intense peak producing side bands of decreasing intensity that are symmetrically distributed around the main peak; and iii) partial ringing where only a subset of the side bands are observed for an intense peak. Fuzzy sites and partial ringing appear to be novel artifacts previously unreported in the literature and we hypothesize that all three artifact types derive from Fourier transformation-based issues. In some spectra, these artifacts account for roughly a third of the peaks present in the given spectrum. We have developed a set of tools to detect these artifacts and approaches to mitigate their effects on downstream analyses."},

While the restoration effort is not complete and the ecosystem continues to experience short duration perturbations, a better understanding of long-term C dynamics of the Everglades is needed to facilitate new restoration efforts. This study evaluated temporal trends of different aquatic carbon (C) pools of the northern Everglades Protection Area over a 20-year period to gauge historic C cycling patterns. Dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC), particulate organic C (POC), and surface water carbon dioxide (pCO2(aq)) were investigated between May 1, 1994 and April 30, 2015.  Results: Annual mean concentrations of DIC, DOC, POC, and pCO2(aq) significantly decreased through time or remained constant across the Water Conservation Areas (WCAs). Overall, the magnitude of the different C pools in the water column significantly differed between regions. Outgassing of CO2 was dynamic across the Everglades ranging from 420 to 2001 kg CO2 yr-1. Overall the historic trend in CO2 flux from the marsh declined across our study area while pCO2(aq) largely remained somewhat constant with the exception of Water Conservation Area 2 which experienced significant declines in pCO2(aq). Particulate OC concentrations were consistent between WCAs, but a significantly decreasing trend in annual POC concentrations were observed.  Conclusions: Hydrologic condition and nutrient inputs significantly influenced the balance, speciation, and flux of C pools across WCAs suggesting a subsidy-stress response in C dynamics relative to landscape scale responses in nutrient availability. The interplay between nutrient inputs and hydrologic condition exert a driving force on the balance between DIC and DOC production via the metabolism of organic matter which forms the base of the aquatic foodweb. Along the restoration trajectory as water quality and hydrology continues to improve it is expected that C pools will respond accordingly."},

To understand underlying mechanisms, we derived mathematical population models of adult neurogenesis that explain the observed clonal cell type abundances. Models fitting the data best consistently show self renewal of transit amplifying progenitors and rapid neuroblast cell cycle exit.

METHODS: Participants from a birth cohort completing assessments of search speed, verbal memory and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination at age 69 were asked about delirium symptoms between ages 60-69. Linear regression models estimated associations between delirium symptoms and cognitive outcomes.  RESULTS: Period prevalence of delirium between 60 and 69 was 4%. Delirium symptoms over the seventh decade were associated with worse search speed and ACE-III scores (-1.7 points, 95%CI -3.2, -0.1, p=0.04). In relation to delirium symptoms, verbal memory was initially worse, followed by subsequent decline in search speed by age 69. These effects were independent of other Alzheimer's risk factors.  DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that delirium symptoms may be common even at relatively younger ages, and that its presence may herald cognitive decline over this time period."},

Aside from the obvious artifacts induced by the magnetic pulses themselves, separate and more sinister signal disturbances arise as a result of contact between the TMS coil and EEG electrodes.  New method: Here we profile the characteristics of these artifacts and introduce a simple device, the coil spacer, to provide a platform allowing physical separation between the coil and electrodes during stimulation.  Results: EEG data revealed high amplitude signal disturbances when the TMS coil was in direct contact with the EEG electrodes, well within the physiological range of viable EEG signals. The largest artifacts were located in the Delta and Theta frequency range, and standard data cleanup using independent components analysis (ICA) was ineffective due to the artifacts similarity to real brain oscillations.  Comparison with Existing Method: While the current best practice is to use a large coil holding apparatus to fixate the coil hovering over the head with an air gap, the spacer provides a simpler solution that ensures this distance is kept constant throughout testing.  Conclusions: The results strongly suggest that data collected from combined TMS-EEG studies with the coil in direct contact with the EEG cap are polluted with low frequency artifacts that are indiscernible from physiological brain signals. The coil spacer provides a cheap and simple solution to this problem and is recommended for use in future simultaneous TMS-EEG recordings."},

IL4/13 restores Dystrophin production by inducing changes in the Dmd pre-mRNA splicing pattern that exclude the mutated exon and restore the reading frame. We further show that systemic delivery of IL4-Fc can restore Dystrophin in multiple muscle groups and increase muscle endurance and strength in mdx mice. Importantly, IL4/13 treatment of mdx myoblasts is sufficient to induce exon skipping and restore Dmd reading frame in vitro. Moreover, IL4-treated DMD patient myoblasts produce Dystrophin-positive myofibers after transplantation.

Host preferences assays using odor-baited traps revealed no effect of infection on mosquito long-range anthropophily. However, the identification of the blood meal origin of mosquitoes showed that females carrying sporozoites, the mature transmissible stage of the parasite, were 24% more anthropophagic than both females harbouring oocysts, the parasite immature stage, and uninfected individuals.

This increase in transmission potential highlights the importance of vector control tools targeting infectious females."},

This planar polarized PAR module then controls actin planar organization, thus determining the orientation of cell shape changes and the elongation axis of the whole embryo. This trans-tissular mechanotransduction pathway thus contributes to coordinate the morphogenesis of three embryonic tissues."},

To determine the genetic requirements for aggregate uptake, we individually knocked out the major genes of the HSPG synthesis pathway using CRISPR/Cas9 in HEK293T cells. Knockout of EXT1, EXT2 and EXTL3, N-sulfotransferase (NDST1), and 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST2) significantly reduced tau uptake. \u03b1-Synuclein was not sensitive to HS6ST2 knockout. Good correlation between pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of GAG binding by tau and \u03b1-synuclein indicates specificity that may help elucidate a path to mechanism-based inhibition of transcellular propagation of pathology."},

Wright", "Feng Cui"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/207167 ", "abstract": "The rotational positioning of nucleosomes is associated with certain periodic DNA patterns, with the well-known preference of WW dinucleotides (where W is A or T) and SS dinucleotides (where S is G or C) to occur at the sites where nucleosomeal DNA bends into the minor and major grooves, respectively. However, cis- and trans-acting factors governing this nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) pattern remain unclear. To identify these factors, we performed a systematic analysis of WW/SS patterns within 147-bp nucleosome core particle fragments in different eukaryotes under multiple cellular conditions. We find that >50% of nucleosomes in the genomes do not have this NPS pattern and >20% of nucleosomes take the inverse, anti-NPS pattern. The fraction of anti-NPS nucleosomes is increased in cells lacking one or more chromatin remodelers and in genes with high RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription frequencies. Remarkably, anti-NPS nucleosomes exhibit distinctive distributions across the yeast and human genomes: the nucleosomes are distributed uniformly in yeast, while in humans they are more enriched at promoters and coding regions than at repetitive DNA elements. Such differences can be explained by intrinsic DNA sequence patterns. Thus, our results suggest that the rotational positioning of nucleosomes can be influenced, in a synergic manner, by cis and trans determinants including DNA sequence, ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling enzymes and RNA Pol II."},

In contrast to what happens in natural situations, experimental studies of seasonal plasticity typically test environmental conditions held constant during development. We tested effects of circadian temperature fluctuations on a series of thermally plastic traits in a model of adaptive seasonal plasticity, the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Comparing phenotypes from butterflies reared under two types of fluctuations (warmer days with cooler nights, and cooler days with warmer nights) and butterflies reared under a constant temperature of the same daily average allowed us to identify complex patterns of response to day and night temperatures. We found evidence of additive-like effects (for body size), but also different types of interactions, such as \"dominance\"-type effects where one particular period of the light cycle (for development time) or one particular extreme temperature (for eyespot size) had a relatively larger contribution to phenotype expression. We also gathered evidence against the hypothesis that thermal plasticity in development time is what drives thermal plasticity in other traits. Our study underscores the importance of understanding how organisms integrate complex environmental information towards a complete understanding of natural phenotypic variation and of the impact of environmental change thereon."},

We test this hypothesis by studying a model in which the demography and genetic composition of the population are both determined by the behavior of the individuals within the population. We propose an effective population size that allows us to compare our model with the classical Wright-Fisher diffusion both for neutral alleles and those under selection. We find that using our approximation for the effective population size, the Wright-Fisher diffusion provides good results for the times to absorption and probabilities of fixation of a given neutral allele and in cases where selection is not too strong. However, the times and laws to fixation are not always well predicted due to large fluctuations in population size caused by small growth rates or strong competition between individuals, that cannot be captured by the constant population size approximation. The discrepancy between our model and the Wright-Fisher diffusion is accentuated in the presence of demo-genetic feed-back. Our results imply that the Wright-Fisher diffusion is not appropriate when studying probabilities and times to fixation in long-lived species with low reproductive rates."},

In particular, non-LTR retrotransposons (N-LTRrs) extensively shaped the human genome throughout evolution. In this study, we compared retrotransposon insertions differentially present in the genomes of Anatomically Modern Humans, Neanderthals, Denisovans and Chimpanzees, in order to assess the possible impact of retrotransposition in the differentiation of the human lineage. Briefly, we first identified species-specific N-LTRrs and established their distribution in present day human populations. These analyses shortlisted a group of N-LTRr insertions that were found exclusively in Anatomically Modern Humans. Notably, these insertions targeted genes more frequently than randomly expected and are associated with an increase in the number of transcriptional/splicing variants of those genes they inserted in. The analysis of the functionality of genes targeted by human-specific N-LTRr insertions seems to reflect phenotypic changes that occurred during human evolution. Furthermore, the expression of genes containing the most recent N-LTRr insertions is enriched in the brain, especially in undifferentiated neurons, and these genes associate in networks related to neuron maturation and migration. Additionally, we also identified candidate N-LTRr insertions that have likely produced new functional variants exclusive to modern humans, which show traces of positive selection and are now fixed in all present-day human populations. In sum, our results strongly suggest that N-LTRr impacted our differentiation as a species and have been a constant source of genomic variability all throughout the evolution of the human lineage."},

Using minute by minute EMR data from fifty thousand surgeries we developed and tested a machine learning based system called Prescience that predicts real-time hypoxemia risk and presents an explanation of factors contributing to that risk during general anesthesia. Prescience improved anesthesiologists' performance when providing interpretable hypoxemia risks with contributing factors. The results suggest that if anesthesiologists currently anticipate 15% of events, then with Prescience assistance they could anticipate 30% of events or an estimated additional 2.4 million annually in the US, a large portion of which may be preventable because they are attributable to modifiable factors. The prediction explanations are broadly consistent with the literature and anesthesiologists' prior knowledge.  Prescience can also improve clinical understanding of hypoxemia risk during anesthesia by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain patient or procedure characteristics. Making predictions of complex medical machine learning models (such as Prescience) interpretable has broad applicability to other data-driven prediction tasks in medicine."},

For murine IgG3 (mIgG3) the identity of its receptors (and the very existence of a receptor) is still under debate, as not all mIgG3 functions can be explained by interaction with Fc\u03b3-receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI). This implies the existence of an alternate receptor, whose identity we sought to pinpoint. We found that blockage of the alpha4/beta1 integrin (Itga4/Itgb1) selectively hampered binding of mIgG3 to macrophages and mIgG3-mediated phagocytosis. Manganese, an integrin activator, increased mIgG3 binding to macrophages. Blockage of Fc\u03b3RI or Itgb1 inhibited binding of different mIgG3 antibodies to variable extents. Our results indicate an integrin component in the mIgG3 receptor. Given the more ancient origin of integrins in comparison with Fc\u03b3R, this observation could have far ranging implications for our understanding of the evolution of antibody-mediated immunity, as well as in immunity to microorganisms, pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and antibody engineering."},

Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis, and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how Fat1 exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation, but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner motor neurons. Here, we show that constitutive Fat1 disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. Fat1 is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue as a cell type in which Fat1 activity is required for the non-cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, Fat1 is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how Fat1 coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types."},

Linear mixed models, with random intercepts and slopes, were conducted to test the association between APOE and the rate of decline in these cognitive scores from age 43 to 69. Model fit was assessed with the Bayesian Information Criterion. A cross-sectional association between APOE-\u03f54 and memory scores was detected at age 69 for both heterozygotes and homozygotes (\u03b2=-0.68 & \u03b2=-1.38 respectively, p=.03) with stronger associations in homozygotes; no associations were observed before this age. Homozygous carriers of APOE-\u03f54 had a faster rate of decline in memory between ages 43 and 69, when compared to non-carriers, after adjusting for gender and childhood cognition (\u03b2=-0.05, p=.04). There were no cross-sectional or longitudinal associations between APOE-\u03f54 and processing speed. We conclude that APOE-\u03f54 is associated with a subtly faster rate of memory decline from midlife to early old age; this may be due to effects of APOE-\u03f54 becoming manifest around the latter stage of life.

Modest STR expansions are found in most strains, some of which have evident functional effects. For instance, three of six intronic STR expansions are associated with intron retention. Coding STRs are depleted of variation relative to non-coding STRs, consistent with the action of purifying selection, and some STRs show hypervariable patterns consistent with diversifying selection. Finally, we detect dozens of novel STR-phenotype associations that could not be detected with SNPs alone, validating several with follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that STRs comprise a large, unascertained reservoir of functionally relevant genomic variation."},

We show that med2\u2206 med3\u2206 med15\u2206 yeast are viable and that Mediator lacking Med2-Med3-Med15 is associated with active promoters genome-wide. To test whether Mediator might alternatively be recruited via interactions with the PIC, we examined Mediator association genome-wide after depleting PIC components. We found that depletion of Taf1, Rpb3, and TBP profoundly affected Mediator association at active gene promoters, with TBP being critical for transit of Mediator from UAS to promoter, while Pol II and Taf1 stabilize Mediator association at proximal promoters."},

DDK is also required for efficient fork restart and G2/M cell cycle arrest. DDK exhibits genetic interactions with the ssDNA exonuclease EXO1, and we show that EXO1 is also required for nascent strand degradation following exposure to HU, raising the possibility that DDK regulates EXO1 directly. Thus, DDK has a primary and previously undescribed role in the replication checkpoint to promote ssDNA accumulation at stalled forks, which is required to initiate a robust checkpoint response and cell cycle arrest to maintain genome integrity."},

Here, we take the single enzyme perspective and rebuild the theory of enzymatic inhibition from the bottom up. We find that accounting for multi-conformational enzyme structure and intrinsic randomness cannot undermine the validity of classical results in the case of competitive inhibition; but that it should strongly change our view on the uncompetitive and mixed modes of inhibition. There, stochastic fluctuations on the single-enzyme level could give rise to inhibitor-activator duality -- a phenomenon in which, under some conditions, the introduction of a molecule whose binding shuts down enzymatic catalysis will counter intuitively work to facilitate product formation. We state -- in terms of experimentally measurable quantities -- a mathematical condition for the emergence of inhibitor-activator duality, and propose that it could explain why certain molecules that act as inhibitors when substrate concentrations are high elicit a non-monotonic dose response when substrate concentrations are low. The fundamental and practical implications of our findings are thoroughly discussed."},

High light and herbaceous growth form have been hypothesized to favor amphistomy, but these hypotheses have not been rigourously tested together using phylogenetic comparative methods. I leveraged a large dataset including stomatal ratio, Ellenberg light indicator value, growth form, and phylogenetic relationships for 372 species of British angiosperms. I used phylogenetic comparative methods to test how light and/or growth form influence stomatal ratio and density. High light and herbaceous growth form are correlated with amphistomy, as predicted, but they also interact; the effect of light is pronounced in therophytes (annuals) and perennial herbs, but muted in phanerophytes (shrubs and trees). Furthermore, amphistomy and stomatal density evolve together in response to light. Comparative analyses of British angiosperms reveal two major insights into physiological evolution. First, light and growth form interact to shape variation in stomatal ratio; amphistomy is common under high light, but mostly for herbs. Second, coordinated evolution of adaxial stomatal density and light tolerance indicates that amphistomy is an important adaptation to optimally balance light acquisition with gas exchange. These results advance our understanding of why stomatal ratio evolves and its potential as a functional trait for paleoecology and crop improvement."},

Recent findings in humans have implied an additive influence, suggesting distinct sources of bias that act on visual selection (additive-bias hypothesis). Alternately, neuroeconomic evidence suggests that the brain applies an expected-value operation, where the likelihood that a spatial location will become task relevant (spatial-certainty) is multiplied by the reward-value of that location (spatial-value). We sought to arbitrate between these two alternatives, and furthermore, to test whether these conflicting accounts have arisen because both operations are available to the visual-selection system, and their manifestation is context dependent (mixed-operations hypothesis). Over two experiments we tested whether the influence of predictions and reward remained additive, even under conditions that stressed the optimality of an additive operation. Participants completed an endogenous cueing task. Spatial-certainty varied across blocks, and targets appeared in coloured circles that were associated with high or low reward values. In Experiment 1 we tested multiple conditions of spatial-certainty, and more densely sampled high certainty-levels, under the assumption that this would free more resources for the influence of spatial-value, should the two share underlying resources. In Experiment 2, potential reward value was manipulated so that an expected-value operation was objectively more profitable. Across both experiments, the additive-bias hypothesis clearly outperformed the expected-value and mixed-operations hypotheses. These findings refute theories that expected-value computations are the singular mechanism underlying the deployment of endogenous spatial attention. Instead, and even when suboptimal, spatial-certainties and spatial-values are parcellated by the selective attention system."},

To address this question, we trained mice to seek reward at several locations on virtual linear tracks, and optical recordings of calcium activity were made at cellular resolution from two major hippocampal output structures, CA1 and the subiculum. These experiments revealed a population of neurons that were consistently active near reward locations. Their pattern of activity sharply contrasted with simultaneously-recorded place cells and even persisted across environments, when other cells remapped randomly. Their timing was closely correlated with reward anticipation behaviors, yet could not be explained by the behaviors themselves, raising the possibility that reward-associated cell signals were used by mice to identify the reward location. These results demonstrate that the hippocampus employs a context-invariant marker of goal locations, and reveal a novel target for studying how the hippocampus contributes to navigation."},

Economic evaluations of antimicrobials and interventions such as diagnostics and vaccines that affect their consumption rarely include the costs of AMR, resulting in sub-optimal policy recommendations. We estimate the economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed, stratified by drug class and national income level.  Methods: The model comprises three components: correlation coefficients between human antibiotic consumption and subsequent resistance; the economic costs of AMR for key pathogens; and consumption data for antibiotic classes driving resistance in these organisms. These were used to calculate the economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed for different drug classes, using data from Thailand and the United States to represent low/middle and high income countries.  Results: The correlation coefficients between consumption of antibiotics that drive resistance in S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumanii, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae and resistance were 0.37, 0.27, 0.35, 0.45, 0.52 and 0.62 respectively. The economic cost of resistance per standard unit of quinolones, for example, was estimated at $0.87 in Thailand ($0.2 - $2.6 in best and worse-case scenarios) and $0.83 in the USA ($0.1 - $2.4).  Conclusion: The economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed were considerable, often exceeding their purchase cost. Notwithstanding their limitations, use of these estimates in economic evaluations can make better informed policy recommendations regarding interventions that affect antimicrobial consumption and those aimed specifically at reducing the burden of AMR."},

HSF1 is thought to be regulated by molecular chaperones, including Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90 is proposed to sequester HSF1 in unstressed cells, but visualization of this interaction in vivo requires protein crosslinking. In this report, we show that HSP90 binding to HSF1 depends on HSP90 conformation and is only readily visualized for the ATP-dependent, N-domain dimerized chaperone, a conformation only rarely sampled by mammalian HSP90. We have used this mutationally fixed conformation to map HSP90 binding sites on HSF1. Further, we show that ATP-competitive, N-domain targeted HSP90 inhibitors disrupt this interaction, resulting in the increased duration of HSF1 occupancy of the hsp70 promoter and significant prolongation of both the constitutive and heat-induced HSF1 transcriptional activity. While our data do not support a role for HSP90 in sequestering HSF1 monomers to suppress HSF1 transcriptional activity, our findings do identify a noncanonical role for HSP90 in providing dynamic modulation of HSF1 activity by participating in removal of HSF1 trimers from heat shock elements in DNA, thus terminating the heat shock response."},

Our model identifies prevention strategies that can reduce incidence to negligible levels (i.e., less than 0.1 infections per 100 person-years) 20 years after a targeted Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) campaign. The model assumes that most (default 95%) of the population is reachable (i.e., could, in principle, be linked to effective care) and a modest (default 5% per year) probability of a treated person dropping out of care. Under random allocation or CD4-based targeting, the default version of our model predicts that the TasP campaign would need to suppress viral replication in ~80% of infected people to halt the epidemic. Under age-based strategies, by contrast, this percentage drops to 50% to 60% (for strategies targeting those <30 and <25, respectively). Age-based targeting did not need to be highly exclusive to yield significant benefits; e.g. the scenario that targeted those <25 years old saw ~80% of suppressed individuals fall outside the target group. This advantage to youth-based targeting remained in sensitivity analyses in which key age-related risk factors were eliminated one by one. As testing rates increase in response to UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals, we suggest that efforts to link all young people to effective care could be an effective long-term method for ending the HIV epidemic. Linking greater numbers of young people to effective care will be critical for developing countries in which a demographic 'youth bulge' is starting to increase the number of young people at risk for HIV infection."},

Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates obtained from prospectively-sampled pulmonary TB patients between July, 2012 and December, 2015 were confirmed as MTBC using IS6110 PCR. MTBC lineages were identified by large sequence polymorphism and single nucleotide polymorphism assays and further characterized using spoligotyping and standard 15-loci MIRU-VNTR typing. We used the n-1 method to estimate recent TB transmission and identified associated risk factors using logistic regression analysis. Out of 2,309 MTBC isolates, we identified 1,082 (46.9%) single cases with 1,227 (53.1%) isolates belonging to one of 276 clustered cases (clustering range; 2-35). Recent TB transmission rate was estimated to be 41.2%. While we see no significant difference in the recent transmission rates between lineages of Mycobacterium africanum (lineage 5 (31.8%); lineage 6 (24.7%), p=0.118), we found that lineage-4 belonging to the M. tuberculosis transmitted significantly higher (44.9%, p<0.001). Finally, apart from age being significantly associated with recent TB transmission (p=0.007), we additionally identified a significant departure in the male/female ratio among very large clustered cases compared to the general TB patient population (3:1 vs. 2:1, p=0.022). Our findings indicate high recent TB transmission suggesting occurrences of unsuspected outbreaks. The observed reduced transmission rate of M. africanum suggests other factor(s) may be responsible for its continuous presence in West Africa."},

Here we use Structured-Illumination Microscopy to investigate the dynamic architecture of DSB repair complexes at meiotic recombination sites in relationship to the synaptonemal complex (SC). DSBs resected at both ends are rapidly converted into inter-homolog repair intermediates harboring two populations of BLM helicase and RPA, flanking a single population of MutS\u03b3. These intermediates accumulate until late pachytene, when repair proteins disappear from non-CO sites and CO-designated sites become enveloped by SC-central region proteins, acquire a second MutS\u03b3 population, and lose RPA. These and other data suggest that the SC protects CO intermediates from being dismantled inappropriately and promotes step-wise CO maturation by generating a transient CO-specific repair compartment, thereby enabling differential timing and outcome of repair at CO and non-CO sites."},

In 2013-2016, an outbreak of the Ebola virus disease (EVD), a zoonotic disease spread from animal reservoirs caused by the Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), infected approximately 30,000 people, causing considerable negative social and economic impacts in an unexpected geographical location (Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia). It is not known whether the spatial distribution of this outbreak and unprecedented severity was precipitated by environmental changes and, if so, which areas might be at risk in the future. To better address the major health and economic impacts of zoonotic diseases we develop a system-dynamics approach to capture the impact of future climate, land use and human population change on Ebola (EVD). We create future risk maps for affected areas and predict between a 1.75 and 3.2-fold increase in EVD outbreaks per year by 2070. While the best case future scenarios we test saw a reduction in the likelihood of epidemics, other future scenarios with high human population growth and low rates of socioeconomic development saw a fourfold increase in the risk of epidemics occurring and almost 50% increase in the risk of catastrophic epidemics. As well as helping to target where health infrastructure might be further developed or vaccines best deployed, our modelling framework can be used to target global interventions and forecast risk for many other zoonotic diseases."},

The Extended Strengths and Weaknesses Assessment of Normal Behavior (E-SWAN) reconceptualizes each diagnostic criterion for selected DSM-5 disorders as a behavior, which can range from high (strengths) to low (weaknesses). Initial efforts have focused on Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety, Major Depression, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.  Methods: Data were collected from 523 participants (ages: 5-21 years old) in the Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network - an ongoing community-referred study. Parents completed each of the four E-SWAN scales and traditional unidirectional scales addressing the same disorders. Distributional properties, Item Response Theory Analysis (IRT) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (for diagnostic prediction) were used to assess and compare the performance of E-SWAN and traditional scales.  Results: In contrast to the traditional scales, which exhibited truncated distributions, all four E-SWAN scales were found to have near-normal distributions. IRT analyses indicate the E-SWAN subscales provided reliable information about respondents throughout the population distribution; in contrast, traditional scales only provided reliable information about respondents at the high end of the distribution. Predictive value for DSM-5 diagnoses was comparable to prior scales.  Conclusion: E-SWAN bidirectional scales can capture the full spectrum of the population distribution for DSM disorders. The additional information provided can better inform examination of inter-individual variation in population studies, as well as facilitate the identification of factors related to resiliency in clinical samples."},

In this case control study, we performed genome-wide association and pathways based analysis in a sample of 71 Dutch women who attended an STI clinic who were seropositive for Chlamydia trachomatis antibodies and 169 high risk Dutch women who sought similar health services but who were seronegative. We identified two regions of within-gene SNP association with Chlamydia trachomatis serological response and found that GPCR signalling and cell cycle pathways were also associated with the trait. These pathway level associations appear to be common to immunological sequelae of Chlamydial infections in both ocular and urogenital tropisms.

Three ion-channel data-sets were extracted from literature. Each compound was designated a cardiac risk category based on information within CredibleMeds. The predictive performance of each model within each data-set was assessed via a leave-one-out cross validation. In two of the data-sets Bnet performed equally as well as the leading cardiac model, cardiac safety simulator, both of these outperformed the gold-standard model. In the 3rd data-set, which contained the most detailed ion-channel pharmacology, Bnet outperformed both cardiac models. These results highlight the importance of benchmarking models but also encourage the development of simple models."},

Fluorescent signals from multiple rounds of indexing are computationally combined into a multi-channel image stack and subjected to image segmentation and quantification. A segmentation and linear model algorithm was developed to accurately quantify membrane antigen levels on dissociated cells as well as tissue sections. Leveraging the spatially resolved nature of CODEX multiplexed single-cell imaging data, quantitative de novo characterization of lymphoid tissue architecture was enabled and overlaid onto previously described morphological features. We observed an unexpected, profound impact of the cellular neighborhood on the expression of protein receptors on immune cells. By comparing normal murine spleen to spleens from animals with systemic autoimmune disease (MRL/lpr), extensive and previously uncharacterized splenic cell interaction dynamics in the healthy versus diseased state was observed.

Here, we tested whether these neurobehavioural factors were associated with the heritable variance in obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) in the Human Connectome Project (N = 895 siblings). Cortical thickness findings supported the \"right brain hypothesis\" for obesity. Namely, increased BMI associated with decreased cortical thickness in right frontal lobe and increased thickness in the left frontal lobe. In addition, lower thickness and volume in entorhinal-parahippocampal structures, and increased thickness in parietal-occipital structures in obese subjects supported the role of visuospatial function in obesity. Brain morphometry results were supported by cognitive tests, which outlined that obesity has negative association with visuospatial function, verbal episodic memory, and cognitive flexibility. Personality-obesity correlations were small. We then aggregated the effects for each neurobehavioural factor for a behavioural genetics analysis and demonstrated their genetic overlap with obesity. Namely, all aforementioned neurobehavioural factors had 0.22-0.52 genetic correlations with obesity and the phenotypic correlations were 80%-100% explained by genetic factors. In a separate analysis, brain morphology effects were partly accounted for by the aggregated personality and cognitive factors, as they mediated 8-12% of brain morphology effects on obesity. In summary, obesity has considerable genetic overlap with neurobehavioural factors, which may inform intervention strategies."},

An important question concerns whether listeners have voluntary control over how many sources they perceive. This has been studied using pure tones H and L presented in the repeating pattern HLH-HLH-, which can form a bistable percept, heard either as an integrated whole (HLH-) or as segregated into high (H-H-) and low (-L--) sequences. Although instructing listeners to try to integrate or segregate sounds affects reports of what they hear, this could reflect a response bias rather than an underlying perceptual effect. We had human listeners continuously report their perception of such sequences while we recorded neural activity using magneto-encephelography. During neutral listening, a classifier trained on patterns of neural activity distinguished between periods of integrated and segregated perception. In other conditions, participants tried to influence their perception by allocating attention either to the whole sequence, or to a subset of the sounds. They reported hearing the desired percept for a greater proportion of time than when listening neutrally. Critically, neural activity supported these reports; stimulus-locked brain responses in auditory cortex were more likely to resemble the signature of segregation when participants tried to hear segregation than when attempting to perceive integration. These results indicate that listeners can influence how many sound sources they perceive, as reflected in neural responses that track both the input and its perceptual organization."},

A consistently supported predictor of colonization success is the number of individuals introduced, also called propagule pressure. Propagule pressure increases with the number of introductions and the number of individuals per introduction (the size of the introduction), but it is unresolved which process is a stronger driver of colonization success. Furthermore their relative importance may depend upon the environment, with multiple introductions potentially enhancing colonization of fluctuating environments. To evaluate the relative importance of the number and size of introductions and its dependence upon environmental variability, we paired demographic simulations with a microcosm experiment. Using Tribolium flour beetles as a model system, we introduced a fixed number of individuals into replicated novel habitats of stable or fluctuating quality, varying the number of introductions through time and size of each introduction. We evaluated establishment probability and the size of extant populations after 7 generations. In the simulations and microcosms, we found that establishment probability increased with more, smaller introductions, but was not affected by biologically realistic fluctuations in environmental quality. Population size was not significantly affected by environmental variability in the simulations, but populations in the microcosms grew larger in a stable environment, especially with more introduction events. In general, the microcosm experiment yielded higher establishment probability and larger populations than the demographic simulations. We suggest that genetic mechanisms likely underlie these differences and thus deserve more attention in efforts to parse propagule pressure. Our results highlight the importance of preventing further introductions of undesirable species to invaded sites, and suggest conservation efforts should focus on increasing the number of introductions or re-introductions of desirable species rather than increasing the size of those introduction events."},

Thus, it should not be surprising that expression of these porins is often altered in clinical isolates that exhibit multidrug resistance (MDR). The major regulator of porin expression in Escherichia coli is EnvZ, a canonical sensor histidine kinase (SHK). It allosterically processes periplasmic interactions with MzrA and cytoplasmic osmosensing into a single unified change in the ratio of its kinase and phosphatase activities. Unfortunately, the role of the transmembrane domain (TMD) in communicating these signals across the cellular membrane remains not well understood. Here, we employed in vivo sulfhydryl-reactivity to probe the dynamics of individual TM2 helices within the TMD and demonstrate that upon stimulus perception, EnvZ employs a non-piston-type mechanism of transmembrane communication. In silico coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations with EnvZ TM2 are in agreement with these in vivo results. We conclude by discussing these results within the context of allosteric processing by EnvZ and propose that these results can be used to predict and classify transmembrane communication by various SHKs."},

Feedback has been implicated in attention, expectation, and sensory context, but the cellular mechanisms underlying these diverse feedback functions are unknown. Using specific optogenetic inactivation of feedback connections in the primate visual cortex, we have identified the cellular mechanisms of feedback-mediated modulations of early sensory processing. Specifically, we found that feedback modulates receptive field size, surround suppression and response gain, similar to the modulatory effects of visual spatial attention. A recurrent network model captured these effects. These feedback-mediated modulations allow higher-order cortical areas to dynamically regulate spatial resolution, sensitivity to image features, and efficiency of coding natural images in lower-order cortical areas."},

Here, we describe a similar DNA hypomethylated subtype of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) that is enriched for both inactivating mutations and deletions in NSD1. The 'NSD1 subtypes' of HNSC and LUSC are highly correlated at the DNA methylation and gene expression levels, with concordant DNA hypomethylation and overexpression of a strongly overlapping set of genes, a subset of which are also hypomethylated in Sotos syndrome, a congenital growth disorder caused by germline NSD1 mutations. Further, the NSD1 subtype of HNSC displays an 'immune cold' phenotype characterized by low infiltration of tumor-associated leukocytes, particularly macrophages and CD8+ T cells, as well as low expression of genes encoding the immunotherapy target PD-1 immune checkpoint receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Using an in vivo model, we demonstrate that NSD1 inactivation results in a reduction in the degree of T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, implicating NSD1 as a tumor cell-intrinsic driver of an immune cold phenotype. These data have important implications for immunotherapy and reveal a general role of NSD1 in maintaining epigenetic repression."},

Eighty-one percent (1270) of participants remain active in the study at a current mean age of 64 and 9 years of follow-up. Serially assessed cognition, self-reported medical and lifestyle histories (e.g. diet, physical and cognitive activity, sleep, and mood), laboratory tests, genetics, and linked studies comprising molecular imaging, structural imaging and cerebrospinal fluid data, have yielded many important findings.

Subclinical or worse cognitive decline relative to internal normative data has been observed in 17.6% of the cohort. Twenty-eight percent exhibit amyloid and/or tau positivity. Biomarker elevations, but not APOE or PH status, are associated with cognitive decline. Salutary health and lifestyle factors are associated with better cognition and brain structure, and lower AD pathophysiologic burden. Of paramount importance is establishing the amyloid and tau AD endophenotypes to which cognitive outcomes can be linked.

P. Santiago", "Surjo R. Soekadar", "Jan Born", "Gordon B. Feld"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/206771 ", "abstract": "Whereas sleep-dependent consolidation and its neurochemical underpinnings have been strongly researched, less is known about how consolidation during sleep affects subsequent learning. Since sleep enhances memory, it can be expected to pro-actively interfere with learning after sleep, in particular of similar materials. This pro-active interference should be enhanced by substances that benefit consolidation during sleep, such as D-cycloserine. We tested this hypothesis in two groups (Sleep, Wake) of young healthy participants receiving on one occasion D-cycloserine (175 mg) and on another occasion placebo, according to a double-blind balanced cross-over design. Treatment was administered after participants had learned a set of word-pairs (A-B list) and before nocturnal retention periods of sleep vs. wakefulness. After D-cycloserine blood plasma levels had dropped to negligible amounts, i.e., the next day in the evening, participants learned, in three sequential runs, new sets of word\u2212pairs. One list - to enhance interference - consisted of the same cue words as the original set paired with a new target word (A-C list) and the other of completely new cue words (D-E set). Unexpectedly, during post-retention learning the A-C interference list was generally better learned than the completely new D-E list, which suggests that consolidation of previously encoded similar material enhances memory integration rather than pro-active interference. Consistent with this view, new learning of word pairs was better after sleep than wakefulness. Similarly, D-cycloserine generally enhanced learning of new word-pairs, compared to placebo. This effect being independent of sleep or wakefulness, leads us to speculate that D-cycloserine, in addition to enhancing sleep-dependent consolidation, might  mediate a time-dependent process of active forgetting."},

Bernet", "Guillermo Rodrigo", "Santiago Elena"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/206789 ", "abstract": "Determining the fitness of viral genotypes has become a standard practice in virology as it is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone- and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, under- expression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness, and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts."},

Important breeding habitats for many waterbird species, which have previously been relatively undisturbed, are now being subjected to these anthropogenic pressures. The conservation of the habitats and the species they support is a significant challenge for sustainable development. Even if governments and corporates operating in this fragile environment are committed to sustainable development, there is little information available to avoid, mitigate and manage environmental risk and impacts. Taking a risk management perspective, we followed the International Finance Corporations (IFC) Performance Standard 6 (PS6) criteria on Environmental and Social Sustainability and developed an approach to identify \"critical habitat\", as defined in IFC PS6, for waterbird species breeding in the Arctic. While the range of these waterbirds is roughly known, more accuracy is needed for proper risk assessment. We have therefore gone a step further by modelling suitable habitat within these ranges. Depending on the relevance of the species for IFC PS6 and the level of certainty we separated the classes likely and potential critical habitat. We tested the approach for Russian breeding populations of five Anatidae species (White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons, Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, Brent Goose Branta bernicla, Redbreasted Goose Branta ruficollis and Bewick's Swan Cygnus columbianus bewicki). Likely critical habitats were identified through a review of literature and available data for these waterbird species and multi-species congregations. To address the information gap for most of the Russian Arctic a species distribution modelling approach was used. The outputs of this approach were labelled as potential critical habitat, indicating the lower level of certainty than likely critical habitat. Based on existing information the amount of likely critical habitat is estimated to be at least x,xxx,xxx km2. For the five Anatidae species, X,XXX,XXX km2 potential critical habitat was identified; 95% of these areas were outside of the area boundaries of likely critical habitat for the species. Insufficient data in the east of the study area did affect the results, as some areas known to support breeding populations were not identified as suitable. Conversely, species' distributions may be overpredicted in other areas; It should also be recognized that the analyzed species currently have depressed populations and may therefore only utilize a proportion of suitable habitat available. For risk assessment purposes however, it is better to predict false positives, rather than false negatives. The study indicates that there are large areas in the Arctic that are potentially important for each of the Anatidae species modelled, but are not yet recognised as key important areas. The results confirm that there is still much to learn about waterbird distribution and abundance in the Russian Arctic.  Synthesis and applications: The critical habitat maps produced do not just provide a new source of information for the economic development sector, but provide it in a way that is relevant to the sector and directly applicable. The maps are useful for initial risk assessments of potential developments, to identify likely impacts and to consider mitigation options, in accordance with IFC PS6. Risk assessors should exercise caution and detailed surveys for any development in areas predicted to be suitable for each species should be carried out."},

The key creativity of the method lies in the design and verification of a special adaptor that can be efficiently linked to the 3\u2032 end of single-stranded DNA, which is a double-stranded oligonucleotide with a 3\u2032 overhang of 3 random nucleotides. This method can start with the denatured DNAs or chromatins fragmented by different methods such as Tn5 tagmentation, enzyme digestion and sonication. When applied to Tn5-tagmented chromatin, SALP overcomes the key limitation of the current ATAC-seq method and develops a high-throughput NGS library construction and sequencing approach, SALP-seq, which can be used to comparatively characterize the chromatin openness state of multiple cells simply and unbiasly. In this way, the comparative chromatin openness states of four different cell lines, including GM12878, HepG2, HeLa and 293T, were successfully characterized. This study also demonstrated that SALP-seq could characterize the chromatin openness states with 105 to 500 cells, indicating the high sensitivity of SALP-seq in characterizing chromatin state of cells. SALP should have wide applications in the future biological sciences and biomedicine."},

We used native mass spectrometry in combination with molecular dynamics simulations and in vivo analyses to investigate the roles of membrane lipids in the structure and transport activity of the purine transporter, UapA, from Aspergillus nidulans. We revealed that UapA exists mainly as a dimer and that two lipid molecules bind per UapA dimer. We identified three classes of phospholipids: phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) which co-purified with UapA. Delipidation of UapA caused dissociation of the dimer into individual protomers. Subsequent addition of PI or PE rescued the UapA dimer and allowed recovery of bound lipids, suggesting a central role of these lipids in stabilising the dimer. We predicted a putative lipid-binding site near the UapA dimer interface. Mutational analyses established that lipid binding at this site is essential for formation of functional UapA dimers. Our findings reveal unprecedented level of detail into the nature of UapA-lipid interactions and provide a framework for studying similar eukaryotic systems."},

Existing single-cell sequencing technologies, however, are unable to analyse nuclear (nuc) and cytoplasmic (cyt) RNAs separately and simultaneously. Hence, there remain challenges to discern correlation, localisation, and translocation between them.  Results: Here we report a microfluidic system that physically separates nucRNA and cytRNA from a single cell and enables single-cell integrated nucRNA and cytRNA-sequencing (SINC-seq). SINC-seq constructs two individual RNA-seq libraries, nucRNA and cytRNA per cell, quantifies gene expression in the subcellular compartments and combines them to create a novel single-cell RNA-seq data enabled by our system, which we here term in-silico single cell.  Conclusions: Leveraging SINC-seq, we discovered three distinct natures of correlation among cytRNA and nucRNA that reflected the physiological state of single cells: The cell-cycle-related genes displayed highly correlated expression pattern with minor differences; RNA splicing genes showed lower nucRNA-to-cytRNA correlation, suggesting a retained intron may be implicated in inhibited mRNA transport; A chemical perturbation, sodium butyrate treatment, transiently distorted the correlation along differentiating human leukemic cells to erythroid cells. These data uniquely provide insights into the regulatory network of mRNA from nucleus toward cytoplasm at the single cell level."},

Despite this, it has been difficult to reveal whether these genes also contribute to the natural variation in flowering-time in the worldwide population. Using a new polygenic association mapping method, we earlier revealed 33 loci associated with flowering time variation in the wild collected A. thaliana accessions from the 1,001-genomes project. Together they explained 66% of the additive genetic variation in time to flowering at 10\u00b0C in the greenhouse. Here, we explore how these loci together contribute to the flowering time variation between genetically defined subpopulations collected from the native range of the species. For some loci both alleles were present in all populations, whereas for others one of the alleles was missing in some subpopulations. The globally segregating alleles contributed mostly small individual effects, but together captured the overall pattern of early to late flowering between the subpopulations, illustrating the valuable contribution by polygenic adaptation for flowering time. Several of the loci with local alleles had relatively large effects on flowering and in this way contributed to the more extreme adaptations of some local populations. Several cases of long-range LD between genes in biological pathway were found, indicating a possible role of local coevolution of functionally connected polymorphisms in local adaptation. Overall, this study provides new insights to the polygenic architecture of flowering time adaptation that has facilitated the colonisation of a wide range of ecological habitats by this self-pollinating plant."},

However, there is little evidence to date on the effect of genetic factors on participation.  Methods: Using data on mothers (N=7,486) and children (N=7,508) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we 1) examined the association of polygenic risk scores for a range of socio-demographic, lifestyle characteristics and health conditions related to continued participation, 2) investigated whether associations of polygenic scores with body mass index (BMI; derived from self-reported weight and height) and self-reported smoking differed in the largest sample with genetic data and a sub-sample who participated in a recent follow-up and 3) determined the proportion of variation in participation explained by common genetic variants using genome-wide data.  Results: We found evidence that polygenic scores for higher education, agreeableness and openness were associated with higher participation and polygenic scores for smoking initiation, higher BMI, neuroticism, schizophrenia, ADHD and depression were associated with lower participation. Associations between the polygenic score for education and self-reported smoking differed between the largest sample with genetic data (OR for ever smoking per SD increase in polygenic score:0.85, 95% CI:0.81,0.89) and sub-sample (OR:0.95, 95% CI:0.88,1.02). In genome-wide analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism based heritability explained 17-31% of variability in participation.  Conclusions: Genetic association studies, including Mendelian randomization, can be biased by selection, including loss to follow-up.

Current BE correction methods either need known batch identities (ComBat) or have the potential to overcorrect, by removing true but unknown biological differences (SVA). Even though the effects of technical differences on measured expression have been published, there are no BE correction algorithms that take the approach of predicting technical effects from parameters computed from a fixed reference sample set. We show that a set of signatures, each of which is a vector the length of the number of probes, calculated on a Reference set of microarray samples can predict much of the batch effect in other Validation sets. We present a rationale of selecting a Reference set of samples designed to estimate technical differences without removing biological differences. Putting both together, we introduce the Batch Effect Signature Correction (BESC) algorithm that uses the BES calculated on the Reference set to efficiently predict and remove BE. Using two independent Validation sets, we show that BESC is capable of removing batch effect without removing unknown but true biological differences. Much of the variations due to batch effect is shared between different microarray datasets. That shared information can be used to predict signatures (i.e. directions of perturbation) due to batch effect in new datasets. The correction is blind (without needing to recompute the parameters on new samples to be corrected), single sample, (each sample is corrected independently of each other) and conservative (only those perturbations known to be likely to be due to technical differences are removed ensuring that unknown but important biological differences are maintained). Those three characteristics make it ideal for high-throughput correction of samples for a microarray data repository.

Here, we provide such evidence from a large forest biodiversity experiment with a novel design in subtropical China. Productivity (stand-level tree basal area, aboveground volume and carbon and their annual increment) increased linearly with the logarithm of tree species richness. Additive partitioning showed that increasing positive complementarity effects combined with weakening negative selection effects caused a strengthening of the relationship over time. In 2-species mixed stands, complementary effects increased with functional distance and selection effects with vertical crown dissimilarity between species. Understorey shrubs reduced stand-level tree productivity, but this effect of competition was attenuated by shrub species richness, indicating that a diverse understorey may facilitate overall ecosystem functioning. Identical biodiversity-productivity relationships were found in plots of different size, suggesting that extrapolation to larger scales is possible. Our results highlight the potential of multi-species afforestation strategies to simultaneously contribute to mitigation of climate change and biodiversity restoration."},

Here we define and quantify an antifungal response, termed perseverance, that correlates with clinical outcomes in patients treated with fluconazole, the most widely used antifungal drug. Perseverance is defined by the ability of fungal cells to grow at drug concentrations above the MIC, and is measured either as the fraction of growth (FoG) in drug disk diffusion assays, or as the degree of supra-MIC growth (SMG) in broth microdilution assays. Perseverance is distinct from resistance and is related to the proportion of cells that form colonies at supra-MIC drug concentrations. Higher perseverance correlates with shorter lag times at high drug concentrations, highlighting a critical distinction from tolerance in bacterial populations. Importantly, several adjuvant drugs, including inhibitors of Hsp90 and calcineurin, eliminate perseverance without altering the MIC. We also find that perseverance and resistance are sensitive to mutations in different pathways, underscoring the distinct nature of the two phenomena. Analysis of isolates recovered from clinically persistent or non-persistent infections in immunocompetent patients reveals that persistent isolates show higher levels of perseverance than isolates cleared by antifungals. Thus, perseverance is an intrinsic property of fungal isolates that correlates with the success or failure of treatment in the clinic, and may provide a useful parameter for predicting clinical persistence and choosing appropriate antifungal therapies."},

Therefore, the development of current and future devices may be aided by theory and simulations that help to infer and understand what patients see. A novel computational framework was developed to predict visual perception and the effect of learning with a subretinal prosthesis. The framework is based on the idea that the central visual system efficiently reconstructs the incident image from the retinal output. To implement this idea, a simulation of the normal responses of the major retinal ganglion cell types was used to deduce the optimal linear reconstruction of the visual stimulus from retinal activity. The result was then used to make inferences about visual experience with simulated retinal activation by a subretinal prosthesis. The inferred visual perception obtained with prosthesis activation was substantially degraded compared to the inferred perception obtained with normal retinal responses, as expected given the limited resolution and lack of cell type specificity of the prosthesis. Consistent with the importance of cell type specificity, reconstruction using only ON cells, and not OFF cells, was substantially more accurate. Finally, when reconstruction was re-optimized for electrical stimulation, simulating learning by the patient, the accuracy of inferred perception with prosthesis stimulation was closer to that of natural vision. The reconstruction approach provides a framework for interpreting patient data in clinical trials, and may be useful for improving prosthesis design."},

Here, we investigate two further predictions, namely that ocular radiance is modulated depending on (i) prey presence and (ii) background colour. We describe the \"ocular spark\" as a new behavioural mechanism of ocular radiance. Downwelling light is focused as a spot on the lower iris and redirected sideways. Our model species Tripterygion delaisi can switch between red or blue ocular sparks, or the off state, by subtle eye movement. We show experimentally that these sparks are used differentially depending on the background of the copepods: Blue ocular sparks were used more against red backgrounds, red ocular sparks more against blue backgrounds. This also occurred in the absence of copepods, albeit weaker. The data suggest that ocular sparks are modulated in response to the prey detection context.

These differences have garnered considerable attention over the past decade, with studies highlighting the potential importance of several factors, including historical changes in population size and linked selection near genes. Here, we examine a more realistic neutral model than has been considered to date, which incorporates sex- and age-dependent mortalities, fecundities, reproductive variances and mutation rates, and ask whether such a model can account for diversity levels observed far from genes. To this end, we derive analytical expressions for the X to autosome ratio of polymorphism levels, which incorporate all of these factors and clarify their effects. In particular, our model shows that the genealogical effects of life history can be reduced to ratios of sex-specific generation times and reproductive variances. Applying our results to hominids by relying on estimated life-history parameters and approximate relationships of mutation rates to age and sex, we find that life history effects, and the effects of male and female generation times in particular, may account for much of the observed variation in X to autosome ratios of polymorphism levels across populations and species."},

Here, we demonstrate that a novel TMS-EEG co-registration technique can dynamically monitor individual human variation in perception based solely on EEG resting-state intrinsic effective connectivity probed by TMS-based phase resetting of ongoing activity. We used a bistable stimulus task, where the percept is perceived as either horizontal or vertical apparent motion, to record gamma band interhemispheric integration of information. Fine-grained inter-individual behavioral differences in horizontal motion bias could be measured by tracking resting-state gamma-band effective connectivity from right hMT+ to left hMT+. Thus, our method of triggering intrinsic resting-state effective connectivity in oscillatory dynamics can monitor individual differences in perception via the long-range integration of information. This technique will be useful for the manipulative dissection of individual-scale human cognition mediated by neural dynamics and may also expand neurofeedback approaches."},

However, pair-wise methods cannot discern whether contacts occur simultaneously or in competition on the individual chromosome. We present a novel 3C method, Multi-Contact 4C (MC-4C), that applies Nanopore sequencing to study multi-way DNA conformations of tens of thousands individual alleles for distinction between cooperative, random and competing interactions.

It reveals unanticipated cooperative clustering between regulatory chromatin loops, anchored by enhancers and gene promoters, and CTCF and cohesin-bound architectural loops.

We also find cooperative interactions between further dispersed regulatory sequences of the active proto-cadherin locus. When applied to CTCF-bound domain boundaries, we find evidence that chromatin loops can collide, a process that is negatively regulated by the cohesin release factor WAPL. Loop collision is further pronounced in WAPL knockout cells, suggestive of a 'cohesin traffic jam'. In summary, single molecule multi-contact analysis methods can reveal how the myriad of regulatory sequences spatially coordinate their actions on individual chromosomes. Insight into these single allele higher-order topological features will facilitate interpreting the consequences of natural and induced genetic variation and help uncovering the mechanisms shaping our genome."},

For example, individuals can learn how to reach in novel dynamical environments (\"force fields\", FF) by observing the movements of a tutor. Previous neurophysiology and neuroimaging studies in humans suggest a role for the motor system in motor learning by observing. Here we tested the role of primary motor cortex (M1) in motor learning by observing. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in right hand muscles at rest. MEPs were elicited before and after participants observed either a video adapting her reaches to a FF or a control video showing a tutor performing reaches in an unlearnable FF. We predicted that observing motor learning would increase M1 excitability to a greater extent than observing movements that did not involve learning. We found that observing FF learning increased MEP amplitudes recorded from right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles. There were no changes in MEP amplitudes for control participants who observed a tutor performing reaches in an unlearnable, randomly varying FF. The observed MEP changes can thus be specifically linked to observing motor learning. These results are consistent with the idea  that observing motor learning produces functional changes in M1, or corticospinal networks or both."},

During such adaptation several distinct systems are recruited: cerebellar sensory-prediction error learning, success-based reinforcement, and explicit strategy-use. Although much work has focused on the relationship between cerebellar learning and strategy-use, there is little research regarding how reinforcement and strategy-use interact. To address this, participants first learnt a 20 degrees visuomotor displacement. After reaching asymptotic performance, binary, hit-or-miss feedback (BF) was introduced either with or without visual feedback, the latter promoting reinforcement. Subsequently, retention was assessed using no-feedback trials, with half of the participants in each group being instructed to stop using any strategy. Although BF led to an increase in retention of the visuomotor displacement, instructing participants to remove their strategy nullified this effect, suggesting strategy-use is critical to BF-based reinforcement. In a second experiment, we prevented the expression or development of a strategy during BF performance, by either constraining participants to a short preparation time (expression) or by introducing the displacement gradually (development). As both strongly impaired BF performance, it suggests reinforcement requires both the development and expression of a strategy. These results emphasise a pivotal role of strategy-use during reinforcement-based motor learning."},

We identify two chromatin-state signatures that track the trajectory of \u03b2-cell dysfunction in mice and humans: ectopic activation of bivalent Polycomb-domains and a loss of expression at a subclass of highly active domains containing key lineage-defining genes. \u03b2-cell specific deletion of Polycomb (Eed/PRC2) triggers parallel transcriptional signatures. Intriguingly, these \u03b2-cell Eed-knockouts also exhibit highly penetrant hyperglycemia-independent dedifferentiation indicating that Polycomb dysregulation sensitizes the \u03b2-cell for dedifferentiation. These findings provide novel resources for exploring transcriptional and epigenetic control of \u03b2-cell (dys)function.

To test this hypothesis, we here use a novel method for identifying repeating patterns of network dynamics, and show that resting networks in magnetoencephalography are well characterised by visits to short-lived transient brain states (~50-100ms), with spatially distinct power and phase-coupling in specific frequency bands. Brain states were identified for sensory, motor networks and higher-order cognitive networks; these include a posterior cognitive network in the alpha range (8-12Hz) and an anterior cognitive network in the delta/theta range (1-7Hz). Both cognitive networks exhibit particularly high power and coherence, and contain brain areas corresponding to posterior and anterior subdivisions of the default mode network. Our results show that large-scale cortical phase-coupling networks operate in very specific frequency bands, possibly reflecting functional specialisation at different intrinsic timescales."},

This contradicts positive relationships between selfing and dispersal in empirical data. Critically, previous work assumes density of adults is spatially and temporally homogeneous, so selfing results in homogeneity in propagule production and competition, which eliminates the benefit of dispersal for escaping from local resource competition.  We investigate the joint evolution of dispersal and selfing in a demographically structured metapopulation model where local density varies due to stochastic extinction-recolonisation dynamics. Increasing local extinction rate reduces local density across the metapopulation, which favours high selfing to mitigate mate limitation, but increases heterogeneity in density, which favours high dispersal for escape from competition. Together, these effects produce a positive relationship between selfing and dispersal, and evolution of the GCS. Nevertheless, the relationship between selfing and dispersal is context-dependent, as varying dispersal cost yields a negative relationship. Our results imply that if spatiotemporal heterogeneity in environmental suitability increases towards the range edge, the GCS may evolve there, favouring further range expansion (Cf. Bakers Law)."},

Previous studies have observed a dependence of TMS-induced responses on ongoing brain activity, for instance sensorimotor rhythms. This suggests an opportunity for the development of more effective stimulation protocols through closed-loop TMS-EEG. However, it is not yet clear how features of ongoing activity affect the responses of cortical circuits to TMS.  Objective: Here we investigate the dependence of TMS-responses on power and phase of ongoing oscillatory activity in a computational model of TMS-induced I-waves.  Methods: The model comprises populations of cortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons and a population of cortical layer 5 (L5) neurons and generates I-waves in response to TMS. Oscillatory input to the L2/3 neurons induces rhythmic fluctuations in activity of L5 neurons. TMS pulses are simulated at different phases and amplitudes of the ongoing rhythm.  Results: The model shows a robust dependence of I-wave properties on phase and power of ongoing rhythms, with the strongest response occurring for TMS at maximal L5 depolarization. The amount of phase-modulation depends on stimulation intensity, with stronger modulation for lower intensity.  Conclusion: The model predicts that responses to TMS are highly variable for low stimulation intensities if ongoing brain rhythms are not taken into account. Closed-loop TMS-EEG holds promise for obtaining more reliable TMS effects."},

Its activity is regulated by a positive feedback loop whereby its terminal enzymatic product, H3K27me3, is specifically recognized and bound by an aromatic cage present in its EED subunit, promoting an allosteric activation of the complex stimulating H3K27me3 deposition on chromatin. Here, we report a step-wise feedback mechanism entailing key residues within distinctive interfacing motifs of EZH2 or EED that are found mutated in cancers and/or Weaver syndrome. PRC2 harboring these EZH2 or EED mutants manifest little activity in vivo but, unexpectedly, exhibited similar chromatin association as wild-type PRC2, indicating an uncoupling of PRC2 activity and recruitment. With genetic and chemical tools, we further demonstrated that targeting allosteric activation overrode the gain-of-function effect of EZH2-Y646X oncogenic mutations. These results revealed critical implications to the regulation and biology of PRC2 and a novel vulnerability of PRC2 in tackling PRC2-addicted cancers."},

The neuro-transmitter GABA regulates neuronal activity but its role in modulating AP dynamics itself is unclear. Here we show that GABA indeed changes the AP mechanism: it causes regularly firing hippocampal CA3 neurons to bistably switch between spiking and quiescence, converts graded discharge-to-current relationships to have abrupt onsets, and induces resonance. Modeling reveals that A-currents enable these GABA-induced transitions. Mathematically, we prove that this transition sequence originates from a single universal principle that generically underlies the modulation of AP dynamics in any conductance-based neuron model. Conductance clamp experiments in hippocampal and brainstem neurons show the same transitions, confirming the universal theory. In simulated networks, synaptically controlled AP dynamics, permits dynamic gating of signals and targeted synchronization of neuronal sub-ensembles. These results advance the systematic understanding of AP modulation and its role in neuronal and network function."},

Rational design of functional foods and nutraceuticals has far reaching public health and therapeutic benefits. Understanding ecological dynamics and how phenotypic manipulations of microbe-microbe interactions of the gut microbiota can provide direct health benefit is currently a fundamental question in bioengineering and more widely in the food, diet and health industries. This work considers a hypothetical adjustment of the microbiome by introducing a transgenic bacterial species that contributes to increased exposure of omega 3 fats in the gut by converting them from the omega 6 fats, dominant in the Western diet. The ratio of the two fats circulating in blood are risk markers, indicators of metabolic syndrome and related conditions. In this work, we consider nutritional exposure to a pro-biotic, a live culture of transgenic bacteria contributing omega 3 fats from omega 6 in the diet. Maintaining a long-term co-existence between native (indigenous) and transgenic bacteria is a challenge. Game theory is the appropriate tool for handling this conflict. The long-term co-existence is guaranteed if the two strains engage in the Snowdrift game. Our game theoretic treatment provides the basis of a model mechanism for prophylactic nutritional therapy for metabolic syndrome by the transgenic bacteria, providing support of indigenous gut microbiota and additional supplementation of a pro-biotic."},

Despite the crucial role of mechanochemical signaling in phenomena such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, measuring the cell-generated forces at the interface with the extracellular matrix during these biological processes remains challenging. An ideal method would provide continuous, non-destructive images of the force field applied by cells, over broad spatial and temporal scales, while simultaneously revealing the cell biological process under investigation. Toward this goal, we present the integration of a new real-time traction stress imaging modality, Hilbert phase dynamometry (HPD), with the technique of spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) for label free monitoring of cell growth. HPD relies on extracting the displacement field in a deformable substrate, which is chemically patterned with a fluorescent grid. The displacements introduced by the cell are captured by the phase of the periodic signal associated with the grid, borrowing concepts from holography. The displacement field is uniquely converted into forces by solving an elasticity inverse problem. Because the measurement of displacement only uses the epifluorescence channel of an inverted microscope, we can simultaneously achieve measurements in transmission. We performed SLIM and extracted cell mass on the same field of view in addition to the measured displacement field. We used this technique to study mesenchymal stem cells and found that cells undergoing osteogenesis and adipogenesis exerted larger and more dynamic stresses than their precursor. Our results indicate that the MSCs develop the smallest forces and growth rates. We anticipate that simultaneous cell growth and traction measurements will improve our understanding of mechanotransduction, particularly during dynamic processes where the matrix properties provide context to guide cells towards a physiological or pathological outcome, e.g., tissue morphogenesis, or cancer metastasis."},

Instead, we suggest a model that changes these commands in a discrete way. We use unsupervised machine learning to identify transitions in the state of the muscles, and show that fitting a discrete model to the kinematics of movement using only one parameter predicts the transitions in the state of the muscles. Such discrete controller suggests that the brain reduces the complexity of the motor control problem as well as the wear-and-tear of the muscles by sending commands to the muscles at sparse times.

Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects."},

The sampled strains were collected in a temporal window representing various steps of the epidemics, reflecting predicted effective population size as inferred from whole genome analysis. In addition to slight variations in virulence factor expression and biofilm production that might influence the ecological niches of theses lineages, competitive fitness experiments revealed that the biological cost of resistance to methicillin, fusidic-acid and fluoroquinolone is totally reversed in the presence of trace amount of antibiotics. Our results suggest that low-level antibiotics exposure in human and animal environments contributed to the expansion of both European-ST80 and USA300 lineages in community setting.

Having completed their role, neutrophils must be removed from the inflammatory site, either by apoptosis and phagocytosis or by reverse migration away from the wound, for restoration of normal tissue homeostasis. Disruption of these tightly controlled physiological processes of neutrophil removal can lead to a range of inflammatory diseases. We used an in vivo zebrafish model to understand the role of lipid mediator production in neutrophil removal. Following tailfin amputation, in the absence of macrophages, neutrophillic inflammation does not resolve. This is due to loss of macrophage-dependent production of eicosanoid prostaglandin E2, which drives neutrophil removal via promotion of reverse migration. Knockdown of endogenous prostaglandin E synthase gene reveals PGE2 is essential for neutrophil inflammation resolution. Furthermore, PGE2 signals through EP4 receptors to enhance Alox15 production, causing a switch towards anti-inflammatory eicosanoid signalling, specifically Lipoxin A4. Our data confirm regulation of neutrophil migration by PGE2 and LXA4 in an in vivo model of inflammation resolution. This pathway may contain therapeutic targets for driving inflammation resolution in chronic inflammatory disease."},

In contrast to the appendage components Cep164 and Cep123, LRRC45 was neither essential for docking of early ciliary vesicles nor for removal of CP110. Rather, LRRC45 promotes cilia biogenesis in CP110-uncapped centrioles by organising centriolar satellites and promoting the docking of Rab8 GTPase-positive vesicles. We propose that, instead of acting solely as a platform to recruit early vesicles, centriole appendages form discrete scaffolds of cooperating proteins that execute specific functions that promote the initial steps of ciliogenesis."},

Compared to traditional tissue-level bulk RNA-seq data, single cell sequencing yields valuable insights about gene expression profiles for different cell types, which is potentially critical for understanding many complex human diseases. However, developing quantitative tools for such data remains challenging because of high levels of technical noise, especially the \"dropout\" events.  A \"dropout\" happens when the RNA for a gene fails to be amplified prior to sequencing, producing a \"false'' zero in the observed data. In this paper, we propose a Unified RNA-Sequencing Model (URSM) for both single cell and bulk RNA-seq data, formulated as a hierarchical model. URSM borrows the strength from both data sources and carefully models the  dropouts in single cell data, leading to a more accurate estimation of cell type specific gene expression profile. In addition, URSM naturally provides inference on the dropout entries in single cell data that need to be imputed for downstream analyses, as well as the mixing proportions of different cell types in bulk samples. We adopt an empirical Bayes approach, where parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm and approximate inference is obtained by Gibbs sampling. Simulation results illustrate that URSM outperforms existing approaches both in correcting for dropouts in single cell data, as well as in deconvolving bulk samples. We also  demonstrate an application to gene expression data on fetal brains, where our model successfully imputes the dropout genes and reveals cell type specific expression patterns."},

This targeted areal expansion recapitulates cortical remodeling across evolution, manifests by early childhood and is linked to molecular signatures of heightened metabolic cost. Our results define a new organizing principle in human brain patterning which governs the highly-coordinated remodeling of human brain shape as a function of naturally-occurring variations in brain size."},

Therefore, it is important to elucidate the general principles governing their thermodynamics/folding mechanisms. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to examine the folding/unfolding pathways of the VPK pseudoknot, a variant of the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) PK involved in ribosomal frameshifting. Fluorescent nucleotide analogs (2-aminopurine and pyrrolocytidine) placed at different stem/loop positions in the PK, and laser temperature-jump approaches serve as local probes allowing us to monitor the order of assembly of VPK with two helices with different intrinsic stabilities. The experiments and molecular simulations show that at 50 mM KCl the dominant folding pathway populates only the more stable partially folded hairpin. As the salt concentration is increased a parallel folding pathway emerges, involving the less stable hairpin structure as an alternate intermediate. Notably, the flux between the pathways is modulated by the ionic strength. The findings support the principle that the order of PK structure formation is determined by the relative stabilities of the hairpins, which can be altered by sequence variations or salt concentrations. Our study not only unambiguously demonstrates that PK folds by parallel pathways, but also establishes that quantitative description of RNA self-assembly requires a synergistic combination of experiments and simulations."},

Existing methods for aggregating feature lists from different methods re-quire use of arbitrary thresholds for selecting the top ranked features and do not account for classification accuracy while selecting the optimal set. Here we present a two-stage ensemble feature selection framework for finding the optimal set of features without compromising on classification accuracy.  Methods and Results: We present herein optSelect, a multi agent-based stochastic optimization approach for nested ensemble feature selection. Stage one involves function perturbation, where ranked list of features are generated using different methods and stage two involves data perturbation, where feature selection is performed within randomly selected subsets of the training data and the optimal set of features is selected within each set using the optSelect. The agents are assigned to different behavior states and move according to a binary PSO algorithm. A multi-objective fitness function is used to evaluate the classification accuracy of the agents. We evaluate the system performance using the random probe method and using five publicly available microarray datasets. The performance of optSelect is compared with single feature selection techniques and existing aggregation methods. The results show that the optSelect algorithm improves the classification accuracy compared to both individual and existing rank aggregation methods. The algorithm is incorporated into an R package, optSelect."},

This property arises from the assay technology itself, whereby the number of counts recorded for each sample is constrained by an arbitrary total sum (i.e., library size).

Nevertheless, the necessity of routine mock community analysis beyond initial method development is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we report that our routine use of mock communities as internal standards allowed us to discover highly aberrant and strong biases in the relative proportions of multiple taxa in a single Illumina HiSeqPE250 run. In this run, an important archaeal taxon virtually disappeared from all samples, and other mock community taxa showed >2-fold high or low abundance, whereas a rerun of those identical amplicons (from the same reaction tubes) on a different date yielded 'normal' results. Although obvious from the strange mock community results, due to natural variation of microbiomes at our site, we easily could have missed the problem had we not used the mock communities. The 'normal' results were validated over 4 MiSeqPE300 runs and 3 HiSeqPE250 runs, and run-to-run variation was usually low (Bray-Curtis distance was 0.12\u00b10.04). While validating these 'normal' results, we also discovered some mock microbial taxa had relatively modest, but consistent, differences between sequencing platforms. We suggest that using mock communities in every sequencing run is essential to distinguish potentially serious aberrations from natural variations. Such mock communities should have more than just a few members and ideally at least partly represent the samples being analyzed, to detect problems that show up only in some taxa, as we observed."},

Applying spaced blocks of TBS can affect both the direction and magnitude of plasticity, but the impact of interval duration on these interactions following intermittent TBS (iTBS) is unclear.  Objectives: To assess the effect of interval duration on plasticity magnitude/direction following spaced iTBS.  Methods: 15 healthy participants received three different iTBS conditions on separate days: single iTBS; spaced iTBS with a 5 minute interval (iTBS-5); and spaced iTBS with a 15 minute interval (iTBS-15). Changes in cortical excitability and short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) resulting from iTBS were assessed via motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) measured from the first dorsal interosseus muscle before and up to 60 mins following stimulation.  Results: iTBS-15 increased MEP amplitude up to 60 mins post stimulation, whereas iTBS-5 decreased MEP amplitude. In contrast, MEP amplitude was not altered by single iTBS. Despite the significant effect of iTBS-15 on MEP amplitude at the group level, there was still considerable inter-individual variability, with only 53% of individuals meeting response criteria. Modulation of SICI did not differ between conditions.  Conclusions: The interval duration between spaced iTBS plays an important role in determining the direction of plasticity on excitatory, but not inhibitory circuits in human motor cortex. While iTBS-15 can increase the magnitude of facilitation in some individuals compared to single iTBS, this approach still suffers from high inter-individual variability."},

Nevertheless, we are still lacking conclusive evidence for an inverted U-shaped developmental trajectory for risk-taking, since it is typically not observed in laboratory-based studies. This raises the question whether adolescents are really more risk-takers or when facing a novel risky situation they behave just as children and adults do. To answer that, we used the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to assess the risky decision making of 173 individuals ranging in age from 7 to 29. The BART provided useful data for characterizing multiple aspects of risk-taking. Surprisingly, we found that adolescents were not more inclined to take risks than children or young adults. Participants in all age groups were able to adapt their learning processes to the probabilistic environment and improve their performance during the sequential risky choice; however, there were no age-related differences in risk-taking at any stage of the task. Likewise, neither negative feedback reactivity nor overall task performance distinguished adolescents from the younger and older age groups. Our findings prompt 1) methodological considerations about the plausibility of the BART and 2) theoretical debate about whether the amount of prior experience on its own may account for age-related changes in real-life risk-taking, since risk-taking in a novel and uncertain situation was invariant across developmental stages."},

It remains unclear whether MS risk variants impact cellular function in the central nervous system (CNS) and whether this plays a role in MS susceptibility. Here, we investigated the effect of the risk variant, rs7665090-G, located near the NFKB1 gene, on astrocyte function. In human fetal astrocytes, we found that chromatin was accessible at the rs7665090 locus, suggesting a potential impact of the risk variant on astroglial function. In astrocytes differentiated from MS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and in astrocytes within autopsied MS lesions, the risk variant was associated with increased NF-\u03baB signaling and expression of NF-\u03baB target genes that promote lymphocyte recruitment and neurotoxicity. Consistent with these findings, infiltrating lymphocytes were increased in MS lesions homozygous for the risk variant. Moreover, in MS patients, the rs7665090 risk variant was associated with increased total lesion volumes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Overall, our work establishes that the rs7665090-G variant directly perturbs CNS cell function, resulting in enhanced lymphocyte recruitment and reduced thresholds for lesion formation. Thus, MS may be triggered by a complex interplay between the peripheral immune system and the CNS, where dysfunctional peripheral immune responses are targeted to the CNS e.g. through enhanced astrocytic responses."},

Staresina"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/206151 ", "abstract": "How are brief encounters transformed into lasting memories? Previous research has established the role of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, along with its electrophysiological signatures of slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles, for memory consolidation. More recently, experimental manipulations have demonstrated that NREM sleep provides a window of opportunity to selectively strengthen particular memory traces via the delivery of sensory cues. It has remained unclear, however, whether experimental memory cueing triggers the brain's endogenous consolidation mechanisms (linked to SOs and/or spindles) and whether those mechanisms in turn mediate effective processing of the cue information. Here we devised a novel paradigm in which associative memories (adjective-object and adjective-scene pairs) were selectively cued during a post-learning nap, successfully stabilising next-day retention relative to non-cued memories. First, we found that compared to novel control adjectives, memory cues were accompanied by an increase in fast spindles coupled to SO up states. Critically, EEG pattern decodability of the associated memory category (object vs. scene) was temporally linked to cue-induced spindles and predicted next-day retrieval performance across participants. These results provide highly controlled empirical evidence for an information processing role of sleep spindles in service of memory consolidation."},

Consequently, the verbal paired associates (VPA) task has become emblematic of hippocampal function. This VPA deficit is not well understood, and is particularly difficult for hippocampal theories with a visuospatial bias to explain (e.g., cognitive map and scene construction theories). Notably, however, VPA tasks typically use concrete imageable words and so conflate imagery and binding. To determine why VPA engages the hippocampus, we devised an fMRI encoding task involving pairs of scene words, pairs of object words and pairs of non-imageable abstract words which were closely matched on a wide range of features. Using univariate and multivariate methods we found that the anterior hippocampus in particular was engaged during the encoding of both scene and object word pairs. This was not the case for abstract word pairs, despite binding occurring here also, and even when only subsequently-remembered trials were considered. Moreover, for object word pairs, fMRI activity patterns in the anterior hippocampus were more similar to those for scene imagery than object imagery. This was especially evident in participants who were high imagery users, and not in mid and low imagery users. Overall, our results show that hippocampal engagement during VPA, even when object word pairs are involved, seems to be evoked by scene imagery rather than binding per se. This may help to resolve the issue that visuospatial hippocampal theories have in accounting for verbal memory."},

We show that the first- and second-order judgments relied on the power of beta oscillations (\u03b2 15-40 Hz), while error monitoring subsystems engaged alpha oscillations (\u03b1 8-14 Hz). The spread of an individual's \u03b2 power state-space trajectories during timing was indicative of the individual's metacognitive inference. Our results suggest that network inhibition (\u03b2 power) instantiates a state variable determining future network trajectory; this naturally provides a code for duration and metacognitive inferences would consist in reading out this state variable. Altogether, our study describes oscillatory mechanisms for timing suggesting that temporal metacognition relies on inferential processes of self-generated dynamics."},

However, some TFs display epistasis, with multiple substitutions to their optimal site alleviating each others effects. These TFs can bind to two distinct sequences that represent two local optima in the Gibbs free energy of binding (\u0394G). To determine the molecular mechanism behind this effect, we solved the structures of human HOXB13 and CDX2 proteins bound to their two optimal DNA sequences, CAATAAA and TCGTAAA. Striking differences were observed in the recognition of the distinct part of the sequence. Whereas the CAA trinucleotide was recognized by a network of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds, no such interactions were visible in the TCG structures of both TFs, suggesting that the solvent molecules at the interface were disordered. Thermodynamic analyses by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed that both sites were bound with similar \u0394G. However, the interaction with the CAA sequence was driven by change in enthalpy (\u0394H), whereas the TCG site was bound with similar affinity due to a smaller loss of entropy (\u0394S). Additional analysis of BARHL2 and MYF5 using ITC confirmed the presence of entropic and enthalpic optima also for these TFs that can recognize two distinct sequences. The common presence of at least two local optima is general to all macromolecular interactions, as \u0394G depends on two partially independent variables \u0394H and \u0394S according to the central equation of thermodynamics, \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S."},

Predictions about the loci of past evolution are retrodictions, i.e. inferences about events that occurred in the past. They are not based on elaborate models and they derive mainly from the observation of repeated cases of genetic evolution. Predictions at the nucleotide level or at the gene level have a higher inference gain than those for broader categories of genetic changes such as cis-regulatory mutations."},

The main technical critique of Erlich [2017] builds on a simulation experiment that shows that our proposed algorithm, which uses only a genomic sample for identification, performed no better than a strategy that uses demographic variables. Below, we show why this comparison is misleading and provide a detailed discussion of the key critical points in our analyses that have been brought up in Erlich [2017] and in the media. Further, not only faces may be derived from DNA, but a wide range of phenotypes and demographic variables. In this light, the main contribution of Lippert et al.

{"title": "Topographical and spectral signatures of infant and adult movement artifacts in naturalistic EEG", "authors": ["Stanimira Georgieva", "Suzannah Lester", "Meryem Yilmaz", "Sam Wass", "Victoria Leong"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/206029 ", "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is perhaps the most widely used brain-imaging technique for paediatric populations. However, EEG signals are prone to distortion by motion-related artifacts, which can severely confound interpretation. Compared to adult EEG, motion during infant EEG acquisition is both more frequent and less stereotypical. Yet the diverse effects of motion on the infant EEG signal have not been documented. This work represents the first systematic assessment of the effects of naturalistic motion on infant and adult EEG signals. In Study 1, five mother-infant pairs were video-recorded during naturalistic joint- and solo-play with toys. The frequency of occurrence of 27 different facial and body motions was time-coded for both adults and infants. Our results suggested that movement was continuously present within dyads, and that different types of movement were observed when comparing social and non-social play, as well as adults and infants. In Study 2, one adult and one infant actor each re-created the most commonly occurring facial, limb and postural motions from Study 1, allowing us to assess the topological and spectral features of motion-related EEG artifacts, as compared to resting state EEG measurements. For the adult, all movement types (facial, limb and postural) generated significant increases in spectral power relative to resting state. Topographically and spectrally, the strongest contamination occurred at peripheral recording sites, and affected delta and high-beta frequency bands most severely. Exceptionally, at certain central and centro-parietal channels, virtually no motion-induced power changes were observed in theta, alpha and low-beta frequencies. By contrast, infant motions mainly produced a decrease in alpha power over fronto-central and centro-parietal regions, and was most pronounced for talking and upper limb movements. However, with the exception of peripheral channels, the infant theta band (3-6 Hz) showed little contamination by face and limb motions. It is intended that this work will inform future development of methods for EEG motion-artifact detection and removal, and contribute toward the development of common artifact-related resources and best-practice guidelines for EEG researchers in social and developmental neuroscience."},

Evolutionarily, they are of interest because of the TIM-barrel fold that all these proteins share. Industrially, they have been subjected to many bioengineering process to improve their function. Here, we introduce a framework to analyse the response to selection of GH13 protein structures given some phylogenetic and dynamic information. We found that the TIM-barrel is not selectable (for thermodynamic stability) since it has been under purifying selection during its recent evolution. We also show a method to rank important residues capable of altering towards an optimum. Overall, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of a framework for the analysis of protein structures in a given fitness landscape."},

However, bioinformatics instruction is rarely integrated into life sciences curricula at the undergraduate level. To understand why, the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education (NIBLSE, \"nibbles\") recently undertook an extensive survey of life sciences faculty in the United States. The survey responses to open-ended questions about barriers to integration were subjected to keyword analysis. The barrier most frequently reported by the ~1,260 respondents was lack of faculty training. Faculty at associate's-granting institutions report the least training in bioinformatics and the least integration of bioinformatics into their teaching. Faculty from underrepresented minority groups (URMs) in STEM reported training barriers at a higher rate than others, although the number of URM respondents was small. Interestingly, the cohort of faculty with the most recently awarded PhD degrees reported the most training but were teaching bioinformatics at a lower rate than faculty who earned their degrees in previous decades. Other barriers reported included lack of student interest in bioinformatics; lack of student preparation in mathematics, statistics, and computer science; already overly full curricula; and limited access to resources, including hardware, software, and vetted teaching materials. The results of the survey, the largest to date on bioinformatics education, will guide efforts to further integrate bioinformatics instruction into undergraduate life sciences education."},

The adaptively significant electric organ discharge behavior of weakly electric fish is the direct result of biophysical membrane properties set by ion channels.

The channel produced by this gene shortens electric organ action potentials by activating quickly and at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Surprisingly, the source of these unique properties is a derived patch of negatively charged amino acids in an extracellular loop near the voltage sensor. Further, we demonstrate that this portion of the channel functions differently in vertebrates than the generally accepted model based on the shaker channel, and suggest a role for this loop in the evolutionary tuning of voltage-dependent channels."},

Although, multiple flaviviruses are known to co-circulate in India, when a patient presents with febrile illness, testing is usually limited to specific pathogens. Unbiased metagenomic sequencing of febrile cases can reveal the presence of multiple pathogens and provide complete genome information. Sequence information, a cornerstone for tracing virus evolution, is relevant for the design of vaccines and therapeutics. In order to assess the usefulness of unbiased metagenomic sequencing for the identification of viruses associated with febrile illness, we sequenced serum from four individuals and plasma from one individual, all hospitalized at a tertiary care centre in South India with severe or prolonged febrile illnesses, together with one healthy control in 2014.  Results: We identified and assembled a complete dengue virus type 3 (DENV3) sequence from the serum of a case classified as severe dengue. We also found a small number of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) sequences in the serum of two adults with febrile illness, including the one who had dengue. Phylogenetic analysis of the dengue sequence indicates that it belongs to a predominantly Asian, DENV3, genotype III clade. It had an estimated divergence time of 13.86 years (95% Highest Posterior Densities 12.94-14.83 years) with the closest Indian strain. Amino acid substitutions were present throughout the sequenced genome, including 11 substitutions in the antigenic envelope protein compared to the strain used for the development of the first commercial dengue vaccine. Of these one substitution (E361D) was unique and six were in critical antigenic sites.  Conclusions: We demonstrate that both genome assembly and detection of a low number of viral sequences are possible by unbiased sequencing of clinical material. Complete dengue virus sequence analysis places the sequenced genome in a recent, predominantly Asian clade within genotype III of DENV3. The detection of JEV, an agent not routinely tested in febrile illness in India, warrants further analysis and highlights the need to study co-circulating flaviviruses in parallel."},

The molecular mechanism by which the kinesins depolymerize microtubules and are adapted to perform a seemingly very different activity from other kinesins is still unclear. To address this issue we obtained near atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Drosophila melanogaster kinesin-13 KLP10A constructs bound to curved or straight tubulin in different nucleotide states. The structures show how nucleotide induced conformational changes near the catalytic site are coupled with kinesin-13-specific structural elements to induce tubulin curvature leading to microtubule depolymerization. The data highlight a modular structure that allows similar kinesin core motor-domains to be used for different functions, such as motility or microtubule depolymerization."},

The proteomes of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from elastase-induced mice and COPD patients showed similarities to each other and to colonic mucus. Lung mucus showed a striated, laminated appearance in the elastase-induced mice, COPD and CF, resembling that observed for colonic mucus. Less mucus obstruction was observed in mice lacking the Muc5b mucin. The accumulated mucus plugs of the elastase-induced mice were possible to wash out, but a mucus layer covering the epithelium remained attached to the surface goblet cells also after hypertonic saline washings as widely used in CF therapy. The results suggest that the lung can convert its mucus system into an attached mucus layer that protects the epithelium, similarly to the colon."},

Administering alpha-frequency tACS over 4 consecutive days, we evaluated short- and long-term (> 24 hours) effects of alpha-tACS on local alpha power and oscillatory connectivity, along with behavioral outcomes in anxious arousal and affective sensory perception. The alpha-tACS (vs. sham stimulation) group exhibited increases in posterior alpha power immediately and 30 minutes post-stimulation but not 24 hours post-stimulation, suggesting transient effects on local neuronal synchrony. Strikingly, long-range alpha-frequency Granger causal connectivity (posterior-to-frontal) increased not only immediately and 30 minutes but also 24 hours post-stimulation, paralleled by sustained reductions in anxious arousal and aversion to auditory stimuli. Therefore, tACS is capable of eliciting long-term plasticity in long-range oscillatory connectivity with direct, lasting behavioral consequences, while leaving endogenous local oscillations unaltered. This temporal disparity in local and network effects favors the view of large-scale network strengthening by tACS, calling for research attention to the circuit and network impacts of tACS. Critically, with the growing recognition of large-scale network dysfunctions as a transdiagnostic pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, this connectivity plasticity advocates for the clinical application of tACS with its unique advantage in tackling network pathologies."},

HuD interacts with many mRNAs, altering both stability and translation efficiency. UV-crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC) generated a nucleotide resolution map of the HuD RNA interactome in motor neuron-like cells. HuD target sites were identified in 1304 mRNAs, predominantly in the 3'UTR, with enrichment for genes involved in protein synthesis and axonogenesis. HuD bound many mRNAs encoding mTORC1-responsive ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Altered HuD expression correlated with the translational efficiency of these mRNAs and overall protein synthesis, in a mTORC1-independent fashion. The predominant HuD target was the abundant, small non-coding RNA Y3, which represented 70% of HuD interaction signal. Y3 functions as a molecular sponge for HuD, dynamically limiting its activity. These findings uncover an alternative route to the mTORC1 pathway for translational control in motor neurons that is tunable by a small non-coding RNA."},

Participants 20 years were eligible. Diabetes was defined by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as no diabetes (5.6% [38 mmol/mol]), prediabetes (5.7-6.4% [39-46mmol/mol]), and diabetes (6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) combined with self-reported diabetes. Latent TB infection was defined by the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) test. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of latent TB infection by diabetes status were calculated using logistic regression and accounted for the stratified probability sample. \nResults: Diabetes and QFT-GIT measurements were available for 4,958 (89.2%) included participants. Prevalence of diabetes was 11.4% (95%CI 9.8-13.0%) and 22.1% (95%CI 20.5-23.8%) had prediabetes. Prevalence of latent TB infection was 5.9% (95%CI 4.9-7.0%). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, history of active TB, and foreign born status, the odds of latent TB infection were greater among adults with diabetes (aOR 1.90, 95%CI 1.15-3.14) compared to those without diabetes. The odds of latent TB in adults with prediabetes (aOR 1.15, 95%CI 0.90-1.47) was similar to those without diabetes. \nConclusions: Diabetes is associated with latent TB infection among adults in the United States, even after adjusting for confounding factors. Given diabetes increases the risk of active TB, patients with co-prevalent diabetes and latent TB may be targeted for latent TB treatment."},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether physical activity and other health habits at ages 31-48 years predict objectively measured MVPA decades later.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective twin cohort study in Finland comprised 616 individuals (197 complete twin pairs, including 91 monozygotic pairs, born 1940-1944), who responded to baseline questionnaires in 1975, 1981, and 1990, and participated in accelerometer monitoring at follow-up (mean age, 73 years).  EXPOSURES: Primary exposure was long-term leisure-time physical activity, 1975-1990 (LT-mMET index). Covariates were body mass index (BMI), work-related physical activity, smoking, heavy alcohol use and health status in 1990, and socioeconomic status.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physical activity was measured with a waist-worn triaxial accelerometer (at least 10 hours per day for at least 4 days) to obtain daily mean MVPA values.  RESULTS: High baseline LT-mMET index predicted higher amounts of MVPA (increase in R2 of 6.9% after age and sex adjustment, P<.001) at follow-up. After addition of BMI to the regression model, the R2 value of the whole multivariate model was 17.2%, and with further addition of baseline smoking, socioeconomic status, and health status, the R2 increased to 20.3%. In pairwise analyses, differences in MVPA amount were seen only among twin pairs who were discordant at baseline for smoking (n=40 pairs, median follow-up MVPA 25 vs. 35 min, P=.037) or for health status (n=69 pairs, 30 vs. 44 min, P=.014). For smoking, the difference in MVPA also was seen for monozygotic pairs, but for health status, it was seen only for dizygotic pairs. Mediation analysis showed that shared genetic factors explained 82% of the correlation between LT-mMET and MVPA.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Low leisure-time physical activity at younger age, overweight, smoking, low socioeconomic status, and health problems predicted low MVPA in old age in individual-based analyses. However, based on the pairwise analyses and quantitative trait modeling, genetic factors and smoking seem to be important determinants of later-life MVPA."},

NUMTs are considered \u201cmtDNA fossils\u201d, as they preserve sequences of ancient mtDNA and thus carry unique information about ancestral populations. Our comparison of a NUMT sequence shared by humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas with their mtDNAs implies that, ca. 6 Ma, our evolutionary history involved the interbreeding of individuals whose mtDNA had diverged as much as ~4.5 Myr prior. This large divergence suggests a distant interspecies hybridization. Additionally, analysis of two other NUMTs suggests that such events occurred repeatedly. Our findings suggest a complex pattern of speciation in primate human ancestors and provide a potential explanation for the mosaic nature of fossil morphology found at the emergence of the hominin lineage."},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to normal tidal volume (Vt) mechanical ventilation in a murine model of pulmonary emphysema, which represents the alveolar component of COPD. In this model, two time points associated with different levels of lung inflammation but similar lung destruction, were analyzed.  Methods: C57BL/6 mice received a tracheal instillation of 5 IU of porcine pancreatic elastase (Elastase mice) or the same volume of saline (Saline mice). Fourteen (D14) and 21 (D21) days after instillation, mice were anesthetized, intubated, and either mechanically ventilated (MV) with a normal Vt (8 mL/kg) or maintained on spontaneous ventilation (SV) during two hours. We analyzed respiratory mechanics, emphysema degree (mean chord length by lung histological analysis), and lung inflammation (bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellularity, proportion and activation of total lung inflammatory cells by flow cytometry).  Results: As compared with Saline mice, Elastase mice showed a similarly increased mean chord length and pulmonary compliance at D14 and D21, while BAL cellularity was comparable between groups. Lung mechanics was similarly altered during mechanical ventilation in Elastase and Saline mice. Activated alveolar macrophages CD11bmid were present in lung parenchyma in both Elastase SV mice and Elastase MV mice at D14 but were absent at D21 and in Saline mice, indicating an inflammatory state with elastase at D14 only. At D14, Elastase MV mice showed a significant increase in percentage of neutrophils concomitant with a decrease in percentage of alveolar macrophages in total lung, as compared with Elastase SV mice. Furthermore, alveolar macrophages of Elastase MV mice at D14 overexpressed Gr1, and monocytes showed a trend to overexpression of CD62L, compared with Elastase SV mice.  Conclusions: In an elastase-induced model of pulmonary emphysema, normal Vt mechanical ventilation produced an increase in the proportion of pulmonary neutrophils, and an activation of alveolar macrophages and pulmonary monocytes. This response was observed only when the emphysema model showed an underlying inflammation (D14), reflected by the presence of activated alveolar macrophages CD11bmid."},

Here we present the reprogramming of primary human skin fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using CRISPRa, targeting endogenous OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC and LIN28A promoters. The basal reprogramming efficiency can be improved by an order of magnitude by additionally targeting a conserved Alu-motif, enriched near genes involved in embryo genome activation (EEA-motif). This effect is mediated in part by more efficient activation of NANOG and REX1. These data constitute a proof of principle that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into iPSC using only CRISPRa. Furthermore, the results unravel previously uncharacterized involvement of EEA-motif-associated mechanisms in cellular reprogramming."},

Association with chromosomes is regulated by hook-shaped HEAT repeat proteins that Associate With its Kleisin (Scc1) subunit (HAWKs), namely Scc3, Pds5, and Scc2. Unlike Pds5, Scc2 is not a stable cohesin constituent but, as shown here, transiently displaces Pds5 during loading. Scc1 mutations that compromise its interaction with Scc2 adversely affect cohesin's ATPase activity, loading, and translocation while Scc2 mutations that alter how the ATPase responds to DNA abolish loading despite cohesin's initial association with loading sites. Lastly, Scc2 mutations that permit loading in the absence of Scc4 increase Scc2's association with chromosomal cohesin and reduce that of Pds5. We suggest that cohesin switches between two states, one with Pds5 bound to Scc1 that is not able to hydrolyse ATP efficiently but is capable of release from chromosomes and another in which Scc2, transiently replacing Pds5, stimulates the ATP hydrolysis necessary for loading and translocation away from loading sites."},

At the molecular level, cell identity is determined by the coordinated activation and repression of defined sets of genes. Defects in the maintenance of the genetic programs required for identity can have dire consequences such as organ malformation and cancer. The tumor suppressor L(3)mbt was shown to secure cellular identity in Drosophila larval brains by repressing germline-specific genes. Here we interrogate the temporal and spatial requirements for L(3)mbt in the Drosophila ovary, and show that it safeguards the integrity of both somatic and germline tissues. L(3)mbt mutant ovaries exhibit multiple developmental defects, which we find to be largely caused by the inappropriate expression of a single gene, nanos, a key regulator of germline fate, in the somatic cells of the ovary. In the female germline, we find that L(3)mbt represses testis-specific and neuronal genes. Molecularly, we show that L(3)mbt function in the ovary is mediated through its cofactor Lint1 but independent of the dREAM complex. Together, our work uncovers a more complex role for L(3)mbt than previously understood and demonstrates that L(3)mbt secures tissue identity by preventing the simultaneous expression of original identity markers and tissue-specific misexpression signatures."},

Irwin", "Miriam Liedvogel"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/202168 ", "abstract": "Heterogeneous patterns of genomic differentiation are commonly documented between closely related populations and there is considerable interest in identifying factors that contribute to their formation. These factors could include genomic features (e.g., areas of low recombination) that promote processes like linked selection (positive or purifying selection that affects linked neutral sites) at specific genomic regions. Examinations of repeatable patterns of differentiation across population pairs can provide insight into the role of these factors. Birds are well suited for this work, as genome structure is conserved across this group. Accordingly, we re-estimated relative (FST) and absolute (dXY) differentiation between eight sister pairs of birds that span a broad taxonomic range using a common pipeline. Across pairs, there were modest but significant correlations in window-based estimates of differentiation (up to 3% of variation explained for FST and 26% for dXY), supporting a role for processes at conserved genomic features in generating heterogeneous patterns of differentiation. This suggestion was reinforced by linear models identifying several genomic features (e.g., gene densities) as significant predictors of FST and dXY repeatability. FST repeatability was higher among pairs that were further along the speciation continuum (i.e., more reproductively isolated), suggesting that early stages of speciation may be dominated by positive selection that is different between pairs and replaced by processes acting according to shared genomic features as speciation proceeds."},

Taking into account interactions with other pathogens may be critical to determining the real influenza burden and the full impact of public health policies targeting influenza. That necessity is particularly true for mathematical modeling studies, which have become critical in public health decision-making, despite their usually focusing on lone influenza virus acquisition and infection, thereby making broad oversimplifications regarding pathogen ecology. Herein, we review evidence of influenza virus interaction with bacteria and viruses, and the modeling studies that incorporated some of these. Despite the many studies examining possible associations between influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitides, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, etc., very few mathematical models have integrated other pathogens alongside influenza. A notable exception is the recent modeling of the pneumococcus-influenza interaction, which highlighted potential influenza-related increased pneumococcal transmission and pathogenicity. That example demonstrates the power of dynamic modeling as an approach to test biological hypotheses concerning interaction mechanisms and estimate the strength of those interactions. We explore how different interference mechanisms may lead to unexpected incidence trends and misinterpretations. Using simple transmission models, we illustrate how existing interactions might impact public health surveillance systems and demonstrate that the development of multipathogen models is essential to assess the true public health burden of influenza, and help improve planning and evaluation of control measures. Finally, we identify the public health needs, surveillance, modeling and biological challenges, and propose avenues of research for the coming years."},

Davydov", "Nicolas Salamin", "Marc Robinson-Rechavi"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/174839 ", "abstract": "There are numerous sources of variation in the rate of synonymous substitutions inside genes, such as direct selection on the nucleotide sequence, or mutation rate variation. However the majority of the codon models which are developed and widely used today still incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we propose a simple yet effective extension to codon models, which incorporates codon substitution rate variation along the gene sequence. We find strong effects of substitution rate variation on positive selection inference. We also demonstrate that the computational load of our approach remains tractable, and therefore we are able to apply it to genome scale positive selection scans. We apply our new method to two datasets: 767 vertebrate orthologs and 8,606 orthologs from twelve Drosophila species. Our new model is strongly favored by the data, and the support of the model increases with the amount of information. Moreover, it is able to capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we hypothesize that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high CpG mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. Overall, rate variation in substitutions is an important feature to capture, both to detect positive selection and to understand gene evolution, and the approach that we propose allows to do this in genome-wide scans."},

While abundant literature can be found on the extent of anthelmintic resistance across continents, empirical knowledge about associated risk factors is missing. This study brought together results from anthelmintic efficacy testing and risk factor analysis to provide evidence-based guidelines in the field. It involved 688 horses from 39 French horse farms and riding schools to both estimate Faecal Egg Count Reduction (FECR) after anthelmintic treatment and to interview farm and riding school managers about their practices. Risk factors associated with reduced anthelmintic efficacy in equine strongyles were estimated across drugs using a marginal modelling approach. Results demonstrated ivermectin efficacy (96.3% FECR), the inefficacy of fenbendazole (42.8% FECR) and an intermediate profile for pyrantel (90.3% FECR). Risk factor analysis provided support to advocate for FEC-based treatment regimens combined with individual anthelmintic dosage and the enforcement of tighter biosecurity around horse introduction that contributed to lower drug resistance risk by 1.75. Premises falling under this typology also relied more on their veterinarians suggesting they play an important role in the sustainability of anthelmintic usage. Similarly, drug resistance risk was halved in premises with frequent pasture rotation and with stocking rate below five horses/ha. This is the first empirical risk factor analysis for anthelmintic resistance in equids, whose findings should guide the implementation of more sustained strongyle management in the field."},

Currently, it is thought that Drosophila ovarian follicular epithelium elongation requires the planar polarization of the basal domain cytoskeleton and of the extra-cellular matrix, associated with a dynamic process of rotation around the anteroposterior axis. Here we show, by careful kinetic analysis of fat2 mutants, that neither basal planar polarization nor rotation is required during a first phase of follicle elongation. Conversely, a JAK-STAT signaling gradient from each follicle pole orients early elongation. JAK-STAT controls apical pulsatile contractions, and Myosin II activity inhibition affects both pulses and early elongation. Early elongation is associated with apical constriction at the poles and oriented cell rearrangements, but without any visible planar cell polarization of the apical domain. Thus, a morphogen gradient can trigger tissue elongation via a control of cell pulsing and without planar cell polarity requirement."},

Fundamental to the analysis of such scRNA-seq data is the ability to cluster similar or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little guidance with regards to which method offers most accuracy. Answering this question is complicated by the fact that 10X Genomics data lack cell labels that would allow a direct performance evaluation. Thus in this review, we focused on comparing clustering solutions of a dozen methods for three datasets on human peripheral mononuclear cells generated with the 10X Genomics technology. While clustering solutions appeared robust, we found that solutions produced by different methods have little in common with each other. They also failed to replicate cell type assignment generated with supervised labeling approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all clustering methods tested clustered cells to a large degree according to the amount of genes coding for ribosomal protein genes in each cell."},

Accurately predicting mortality risk from chemotherapy is important, but few patient data-driven tools exist. We sought to create and validate a machine learning model predicting mortality for patients starting new chemotherapy. \n\nMethods:  We obtained electronic health records for patients treated at a large cancer center (26,946 patients; 51,774 new regimens) over 2004-14, linked to Social Security data for date of death. The model was derived using 2004-11 data, and performance measured on non-overlapping 2012-14 data.\n\nFindings:  30-day mortality from chemotherapy start was 2.1%. Common cancers included breast (21.1%), colorectal (19.3%), and lung (18.0%). Model predictions were accurate for all patients (AUC 0.94). Predictions for patients starting palliative chemotherapy (46.6% of regimens), for whom prognosis is particularly important, remained highly accurate (AUC 0.92). To illustrate model discrimination, we ranked patients initiating palliative chemotherapy by model-predicted mortality risk, and calculated observed mortality by risk decile. 30-day mortality in the highest-risk decile was 22.6%; in the lowest-risk decile, no patients died. Predictions remained accurate across all primary cancers, stages, and chemotherapies--even for clinical trial regimens that first appeared in years after the model was trained (AUC 0.94). The model also performed well for prediction of 180-day mortality (AUC 0.87; mortality 74.8% in the highest risk decile vs. 0.2% in the lowest). Predictions were more accurate than data from randomized trials of individual chemotherapies, or SEER estimates.\n\nInterpretation:  A machine learning algorithm accurately predicted short-term mortality in patients starting chemotherapy using EHR data. Further research is necessary to determine generalizability and the feasibility of applying this algorithm in clinical settings."},

As a result, spike trains recorded with Multi-electrode Arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to study behaviors of neural connections. Studying the dynamics of neuronal networks requires the identification of both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The detection of excitatory relationships can robustly be inferred by characterizing the statistical relationships of neural spike trains. However, the identification of inhibitory relationships is more difficult: distinguishing endogenous low firing rates from active inhibition is not obvious. In this paper, we propose an in silico interventional procedure that makes predictions about the effect of stimulating or inhibiting single neurons on other neurons, and thereby gives the ability to accurately identify inhibitory causal relationships. To experimentally test these predictions, we have developed a Neural Circuit Probe (NCP) that delivers drugs transiently and reversibly on individually identified neurons to assess their contributions to the neural circuit behavior. With the help of NCP, three inhibitory connections identified by our in silico modeling were validated through real interventional experiments. Together, these methods provide a basis for mapping complete neural circuits."},

One way in which we disambiguate such scenes is through object cues; for example, seeing a boat supports the inference that the foggy scene is a lake. Recent studies have investigated the neural mechanisms by which object and scene processing interact to support object perception. The current study examines the reverse interaction, by which objects facilitate the neural representation of scene layout. Photographs of indoor (closed) and outdoor (open) real-world scenes were blurred such that they were difficult to categorize on their own, but easily disambiguated by the inclusion of an object. fMRI decoding was used to measure scene representations in scene-selective parahippocampal place area (PPA) and occipital place area (OPA). Classifiers were trained to distinguish response patterns to fully visible indoor and outdoor scenes, presented in an independent experiment. Testing these classifiers on blurred scenes revealed a strong improvement in classification in left PPA and OPA when objects were present, despite the reduced low-level visual feature overlap with the training set in this condition. These findings were specific to left PPA/OPA, with no evidence for object-driven facilitation in right PPA/OPA, object-selective areas, and early visual cortex. These findings demonstrate separate roles for left and right scene-selective cortex in scene representation, whereby left PPA/OPA represents inferred scene layout, influenced by contextual object cues, and right PPA/OPA represents a scene's visual features."},

We measured the dynamics and genetic diversity of B cell responses of five adults longitudinally before and after influenza vaccination using high-throughput antibody repertoire sequencing. We identified vaccine-responsive B cell lineages that carry signatures of selective sweeps driven by positive selection, and discovered that they often display evidence for selective sweeps favoring multiple subclones. We also found persistent B cell lineages that exhibit stable population dynamics and carry signatures of neutral drift. By exploiting the linkage between B cell fitness and antibody binding affinity, we demonstrated the potential for using signatures of selection to identify antibodies with high binding affinity. This quantitative characterization reveals that antibody repertoires are shaped by an unexpectedly broad spectrum of evolutionary processes and shows how signatures of evolutionary history can be harnessed for antibody discovery and engineering."},

We found that all three patches contain high concentrations of hue-selective cells, and the three patches use distinct computational strategies to represent colored objects: while all three patches multiplex hue and shape information, shape-invariant hue information is much stronger in anterior color patches ALC/AMC than CLC; furthermore, hue and object shape specifically for primate faces/bodies are over-represented in AMC but not in the other two patches."},

The framework involves use of a fluorescence quenching-based near-infrared voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Using normalized time-frequency analysis on temporal PA sequences, the neural activity in the seizure group was distinguished from those of the control groups.

We demonstrate that two nucleation mechanisms control spontaneous Ex1Q49 fibrillogenesis: (1) a relatively slow primary fibril-independent nucleation process, which involves the spontaneous formation of aggregation-competent monomers, and (2) a fast secondary fibril-dependent nucleation process, which involves branching and promotes the rapid assembly of highly complex fibril bundles with multiple ends. The proposed aggregation mechanism is supported by studies with the small molecule O4, which perturbs primary nucleation and delays Ex1Q49 fibril assembly, comprehensive mathematical and computational modelling studies, and seeding experiments with small, preformed fibrillar Ex1Q49 aggregates.

In many eukaryotes, spindle pole separation is driven by Kinesin-5 that generates outward force. This outward force is balanced by antagonistic inward force elicited by Kinesin-14 and/or Dynein. In fission yeast, two Kinesin-14s, Pkl1 and Klp2, play an opposing role against Kinesin-5/Cut7. However, how these two Kinesin-14s coordinate individual activities remains elusive. Here we show that while deletion of either pkl1 or klp2 rescues temperature sensitive cut7 mutants, only pkl1 deletion can bypass the lethality caused by cut7 deletion. Pkl1 is tethered to the spindle pole body, while Klp2 is localized along the spindle microtubule. Forced targeting of Klp2 to the spindle pole body, however, compensates for Pkl1 functions, indicating that cellular localizations, rather than individual motor specificities, differentiate between the two Kinesin-14s. Interestingly, human Kinesin-14/HSET can replace either Pkl1 or Klp2. Moreover, overproducing HSET induces monopolar spindles, reminiscent of the phenotype of Cut7 inactivation. Taken together, this study has uncovered the biological mechanism of how two different Kinesin-14s exert their antagonistic roles against Kinesin-5 in a spatially distinct manner."},

While the overall developmental program seems to be conserved, there are divergent developmental factors generating cortical diversity amongst mammalian species. In terms of neuronal output some of the determining factors are the size of the founder population, the duration of cortical neurogenesis, the proportion of different progenitor types, and the fine-tuned balance between self-renewing and differentiative divisions. We develop a mathematical model of neurogenesis that, accounting for these factors, aims at explaining the high diversity found across mammalian species. By framing our hypotheses in rigorous mathematical terms, we are able to identify paths of neurogenesis that match experimentally observed patterns in mouse, and to extrapolate the corresponding patterns in macaque and human. Additionally, we use the model to identify key parameters that would benefit from accurate experimental investigation. We find that the timing of switch to symmetric neurogenic divisions produces the highest variation in neuronal output. Additionally, we find that an increase in neuronal output does not necessarily reflect a larger size of founder population, and we suggest the need for further experimental quantifications to test our predictions."},

Cas9, a type II CRISPR-Cas effector complex, can be programed with a single guide RNA that base-pairs with the target strand of dsDNA, displacing the non-target strand to create an R-loop, where the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains can cleave opposing strands. Cas9 has been repurposed for a variety of important genome engineering applications. While many structural and biochemical studies have shed light on the mechanism of Cas9 cleavage, a clear unifying model has yet to emerge. Our detailed kinetic characterization of the enzyme reveals that DNA binding is reversible, R-loop formation is rate-limiting, occurring in two steps, one for each of the nuclease domains. Although the HNH nuclease activity is stimulated by Mg2+ with a single measureable Kd, the RuvC activity requires two distinct Mg2+ binding events. The specificity constant for cleavage is determined through an induced-fit mechanism as the product of the equilibrium binding affinity for DNA and the rate of R-loop formation."},

Single-cell RNA- sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a widely-used method due to its ability to identify all cell types in a tissue or organ in a systematic manner. However, a major challenge is to organize the resulting taxonomy of cell types into lineage trees revealing the developmental origin of cells. Here, we present a strategy for simultaneous lineage tracing and transcriptome profiling in thousands of single cells. By combining scRNA-seq with computational analysis of lineage barcodes generated by genome editing of transgenic reporter genes, we reconstruct developmental lineage trees in zebrafish larvae and adult fish. In future analyses, LINNAEUS (LINeage tracing by Nuclease-Activated Editing of Ubiquitous Sequences) can be used as a systematic approach for identifying the lineage origin of novel cell types, or of known cell types under different conditions."},

A barrier to gene flow distorts this classical pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic similarity is decreased  for sample pairs on different sides of the barrier and increased for pairs on the same side near the barrier. Here, we introduce an inference scheme that utilizes this signal to detect and estimate the strength of a linear barrier to gene flow in two-dimensions. We use a diffusion approximation to model the effects of a barrier on the geographical spread of ancestry backwards in time. This approach allows us to calculate the chance of recent coalescence and probability of identity by descent. We introduce an inference scheme that fits these theoretical results to the geographical covariance structure of bialleleic genetic markers. It can estimate the strength of the barrier as well as several demographic parameters. We investigate the power of our inference scheme to detect barriers by applying it to a wide range of simulated data. We also showcase an example application to a Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon) flower color hybrid zone, where we do not detect any signal of a strong genome wide barrier to gene flow."},

Nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) motors exert force on diverse F-actin networks to control cell shapes, but a function for NMII contractility in the 2D spectrin-F-actin network in RBCs has not been tested. Here, we show that RBCs contain membrane skeleton-associated NMIIA puncta, identified as bipolar filaments by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. NMIIA association with the membrane skeleton is ATP-dependent, consistent with NMIIA motor domains binding to membrane skeleton F-actin and contributing to membrane mechanical stability.  In addition, the NMIIA heavy and light chains are phosphorylated in vivo in RBCs, indicating active regulation of NMIIA motor activity and filament assembly, while reduced heavy chain phosphorylation of membrane skeleton-associated NMIIA indicates assembly of stable filaments at the membrane.  Treatment of RBCs with blebbistatin, an inhibitor of NMII motor activity, decreases the number of NMIIA filaments associated with the membrane and enhances local, nanoscale membrane oscillations, suggesting decreased membrane tension.  Blebbistatin-treated RBCs also exhibit elongated shapes, loss of membrane curvature, and enhanced deformability, indicating a role for NMIIA contractility in promoting membrane stiffness and maintaining RBC biconcave disc cell shape.  As structures similar to the RBC membrane skeleton are conserved in many metazoan cell types, these data demonstrate a general function for NMII in controlling specialized membrane morphology and mechanical properties through contractile interactions with short F-actin in spectrin-F-actin networks."},

The aim of the experiment is to identify possible contributors to the sudden decrease in honey bee population over the past 60 years, a phenomenon known as the colony collapse disorder. Analysis was performed on three sets of bees: the control group which was not in contact with pesticides, the infected dead group which was a set of bees suspected to have died due to neonicotinoids, and the infected alive group which was suspected to be under the influence of neonicotinoids. After dissecting the bee samples and extracting their fat bodies, the chemical composition and protein structures of the samples were analyzed using Mid-IR beamline at the Canadian Light Source. Results from the spectrographs of bee samples exposed to neonicotinoids demonstrated possible residual pesticide chemicals within fat bodies. Several spectral peaks were also correlated with possible changes in protein secondary structures within fat bodies of neonicotinoid-affected bees. It is likely that the pesticides caused the change in protein assembly structures, which is known to be correlated with disease, paralysis, and death, coinciding with symptoms of Colony Collapse Disorder."},

The development of isobaric tags (e.g. TMT) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of peptide abundances across several different conditions. These multiplexed approaches are promising in principle because of advantages in throughput and measurement quality. However, in practice existing multiplexing approaches suffer from key limitations. In its simple implementation (TMT-MS2), measurements are distorted by chemical noise leading to poor measurement accuracy. The current state-of-the-art (TMT-MS3) addresses this, but requires specialized quadrupole-iontrap-Orbitrap instrumentation. The complement reporter ion approach (TMTc) produces high accuracy measurements and is compatible with many more instruments, like quadrupole-Orbitraps. However, the required deconvolution of the TMTc cluster leads to poor measurement precision. Here, we introduce TMTc+, which adds the modeling of the MS2-isolation step into the deconvolution algorithm. The resulting measurements are comparable in precision to TMT-MS3/MS2. The improved duty cycle, and lower filtering requirements make TMTc+ more sensitive than TMT-MS3 and comparable with TMT-MS2. At the same time, unlike TMT-MS2, TMTc+ is exquisitely able to distinguish signal from chemical noise even outperforming TMT-MS3. Lastly, we compare TMTc+ to quantitative label-free proteomics of total HeLa lysate and find that TMTc+ quantifies 8.0k versus 3.8k proteins in a 5-plex sample. At the same time the median coefficient of variation improves from 13% to 6%. Thus, TMTc+ advances quantitative proteomics by enabling accurate, sensitive, and precise multiplexed experiments on more commonly used instruments."},

Typically, ICA is applied on wide-band EEG (for example 1 to 100 Hz or similar ranges). Since EEG captures the activities of a large number of sources and the fact that number of the components separated by the ICA is limited by the number of the sensors, only the stronger sources (in terms of magnitude and duration) will be detected by the ICA, and the ctivity of weaker sources will be lost or scattered amongst the stronger components. Because of the 1/f nature of the EEG spectra this biases components to the lower frequency ranges. Here we used a versatile combination of a filter bank, PCA and ICA, calling it multi-band ICA, to both increase the number of the ICA components substantially and improve the SNR of the separated components. Using band-pass filtering we break the original signal mixture into several subbands, and using PCA we reduce the dimensionality of each subband, before applying ICA to a matrix containing all the principal components from each band. Using simulated sources and real EEG of participants, we demonstrate that multi-band ICA is able to outperform the traditional wide-band ICA in terms of both signal-noise ratio of the separated sources and the number of the identified independent components. We successfully separated the gamma-band neuronal components time-locked to a visual stimulus, as well as weak sources which are not detectable by wide-band ICA."},

Regulation of its thickness, although well studied in rounded cells, is less explored in well-spread cells. In this paper, we quantify the variations in thickness and study the contribution of actin polymerization, myosin II activity and spread area of cells. We report an increase in cortex thickness and its variations on disrupting actin network by actin depolymerizing agents or reducing contractility by inhibiting motor activity of myosin II. On spread area reduction by substrate micropatterning, we find reduced cell volume and increased mean & variability of thickness. To validate, we follow cells through de-adhesion with EDTA. The thickness of cortex increases (and oscillates) while the volume of cells reduces with 5-15 mins timescales. Moreover, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging reveals stress fibre dissolution and events of their buckling along with a growing population of micron-sized mobile filaments. We believe that the cytoskeleton responds to the loss of adhesion by contracting and fragmenting, hence leading to cortex thickening. Limiting volume reduction does not suppress cortex thickening on de-adhesion, suggesting that decreased traction stress may be primarily responsible for the cortex thickening."},

However, palm oil is a widely used and profitable crop, so identifying strategies that mitigate the impact of oil palm expansion on biodiversity is important. Riparian reserves (strips of forest along rivers) are protected in many countries for hydrological reasons and also support species that would not otherwise persist in oil palm. However, management guidelines for riparian zones have been informed by relatively few ecological studies. We assessed how the structural features and landscape context of riparian reserves in Sabah, Malaysia affected dung beetle communities. We also tested the use of flight intercept traps to study movement of dung beetles along linear forest corridors. Overall, dung beetle abundance in riparian reserves was 54% lower than in logged forest areas, but all species observed in the logged forest were found in at least one riparian reserve site and both species richness and diversity increased with reserve width. Distance from a large block of continuous forest affected dung beetle community composition but not species richness, abundance, or functional diversity. The amount of forest cover in the surrounding landscape improved the retention of species within riparian reserves, and increases in vegetation complexity corresponded with higher functional richness and functional dispersion. The flight intercept traps did not indicate that there is net movement of individuals out of logged forest areas into the riparian reserves. The species richness of 30 m reserves (the suggested requirement of reserves in Sabah) was only 10% lower than in logged forest, but our data indicate that riparian reserves of at least 50 to 80 m are needed for species richness and diversity to equal that in nearby logged forest. These findings, particularly if they apply more widely to forest-dependent taxa, should be taken into account when setting policy and sustainability guidelines for oil palm plantations, both in areas undergoing conversion from forest and in existing oil palm plantations where forest restoration is required."},

The aim the study was to explore the response-inhibition performance and the neural correlates of inhibition in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients that varied on self-reported trait impulsivity.  Methods: Ten cognitively non-impaired patients with PD were recruited. They underwent a neurological evaluation, a neuropsychological assessment and questionnaires on behavioral mood changes. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BISS-11) provided an integrated measure of trait impulsivity. During an fMRI acquisition, each subject was asked to perform a GO-NOGO task. Associations between BOLD response of the whole brain during the response-inhibition task and trait impulsivity were investigated.  Results: Patients with greater scores on BIS-11 had greater activation of the bilateral presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), bilateral anterior insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, and right temporal parietal junction (TPJ) during response-inhibition. Moreover, a significant association between higher impulsivity scores and worse performance was present (p= 0.038).  Conclusions: Our results suggest that deficit in inhibitory processes may affect everyday life, causing impulsive conduct, which is generally detrimental for PD patients. The strong association between BIS-11 scores, MPFC, pre-SMA and TPJ suggests that greater engagement of that network was needed to maintain behavioral inhibition in more impulsive PD patients. Indeed, neuroimaging of brain activity during GO-NOGO task may be useful in characterizing the clinical profile while evaluating the treatment options."},

The overexpressed ZmCOL3 could delay flowering time about 4 days whether in long day or short day conditions.

Leaf-disc transformation is the most commonly used method for genetic transformation of the tobacco plant. However, one disadvantage of leaf-disc transformation is obtaining a leaf of adequate size. Cotyledons from young seedlings are not ideal for leaf-disc transformation. Due to their small size and fragility, it is common to damage specimens during Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In an attempt to overcome this drawback, a protocol was developed using toothpicks as a tool for inoculation of cotyledons with 2mm diameters. Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 hosting two different plasmids (pC35.BNK.2 or pRB140-Bxb1-op) was used for transformation. Fifty-six putative transgenic shoots (T0) were obtained from pC35.BNK.2 transformation. Among them, 38 (68%) grew roots in kanamycin-containing medium. Thirty-two plants were then transplanted to soil, and 28 plantlets grew into adult plants, were fertile and set T1 seeds. T1 seeds derived from randomly chosen 21 soil-grown T0 transgenic plants were plated on kanamycin selection medium. Among them, 17 lines (81%) showed resistance/susceptible segregation for kanamycin selection. Based on Chi-Square test, 6 out of the 17 lines (35%) are deduced to be single-locus transgene insertion lines. To simplify the protocol, water-prepared Agrobacterium culture (Agrboacterium colonies direct dissolved in water) was used in pRB140-Bxb1-op (with gus gene) transformation. In this study, ~35% putative T0 transgenic lines stained strong blue on their leaf tissues using GUS histochemical staining assay. Both results demonstrate that using toothpicks as a means to deliver Agrobacterium infection on cotyledons of tobacco seedlings is achievable. This approach reduced the amount of wait time for mature true leaves required for existing leaf-disc transformation method. The protocol also demonstrated the advantage of minimizing Agrobacterium overgrowth, with positive impacts on explant fitness, by removal of steps requiring submersion in Agrobacterium culture."},

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is difficult to diagnose in early stages. In this study, a tandem mass labeling approach coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to analyze seven-day urinary proteome changes in a rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis when the clinical scores in the EAE group were \"0\" and no obvious histological changes were observed. Thirty-one urinary proteins were altered, based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, seventeen of these proteins were associated with neurological functions. The top canonical pathways represented by these dysregulated proteins included the acute phase response and metabolic processes. The acute phase response was characterized by an increase in inflammatory factors that are known to cause multiple sclerosis. Additionally, lipid or glucose metabolic alterations may provide clues for future mechanistic studies on multiple sclerosis. Fourteen proteins were identified to have catalytic activities that may contribute to neuronal damage. Furthermore, among the seven proteins that were most affected, six were reported to be expressed in the serum/cerebrospinal fluid/brain tissue of multiple sclerosis patients, thereby indicating that urine can be a good source of biomarkers for the early detection of multiple sclerosis."},

However, because the associated cerebral morphology and experimental methodology results in a profound negative brain-core temperature differential, cerebral temperature changes during functional activation are likely to be principally driven by local inflow of fresh, core-temperature, blood. This presents a confound to the interpretation of blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from such models, since this signal is also critically temperature-dependent. Nevertheless, previous investigation on the subject is surprisingly sparse. Here, we address this issue through use of a novel multi-modal methodology in the urethane anesthetized rat. We reveal that sensory stimulation, hypercapnia and recurrent acute seizures induce significant increases in cortical temperature that are preferentially correlated to changes in total hemoglobin concentration, relative to cerebral blood flow and oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, using a phantom-based evaluation of the effect of such temperature changes on the BOLD fMRI signal, we demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between the two.

Phenotypic profiling of the neurogenic small molecule KHS101 revealed the chemical induction of lethal cellular degradation in molecularly-diverse GBM cells, independent of their tumor subtype, whereas non-cancerous brain cells remained viable. Mechanism-of-action (MOA) studies showed that KHS101 specifically bound and inhibited the mitochondrial chaperone HSPD1. In GBM but not non-cancerous brain cells, KHS101 elicited the aggregation of an enzymatic network that regulates energy metabolism. Compromised glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) resulted in the metabolic energy depletion in KHS101-treated GBM cells. Consistently, KHS101 induced key mitochondrial unfolded protein response factor DDIT3 in vitro and in vivo, and significantly reduced intracranial GBM xenograft tumor growth upon systemic administration, without discernible side effects.

Specific hypotheses suggest that oscillatory coupling may be relevant for the temporal coding of information but to which extent this may translate to conscious timing is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the temporal precision of self-generated timed actions may be controlled by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Using a timing task, we show the existence of significant alpha-beta (\u03b1-\u03b2) PAC, robust at the individual level, and specific to temporal production. Second, an increase in the strength of \u03b1-\u03b2 PAC was associated with a smaller variance in time production, i.e. an increased precision in timing, but there was no correlation with the duration of the produced interval. Our results suggest an active role for \u03b1-\u03b2 coupling in maintaining the precision of the endogenous temporal goal during time production: specifically, \u03b1 oscillations may maintain the content of current cognitive states, thus securing the endogenous temporal code for duration estimation instantiated in \u03b2 band. Oscillatory multiplexing may thus index the variance of neuronal computations, which translates into the precision of behavioral performance."},

Such strategies are most successful if they are calibrated, so that the speed-versus-accuracy trade-off can be properly tuned. In the widely used case of read mapping, it has been so far impossible to predict the success rate of competing seeding strategies for lack of a theoretical framework. Here I present an approach to estimate such quantities based on the theory of analytic combinatorics. In a nutshell, the strategy is to specify a combinatorial construction of reads where the seeding heuristic fails, translate this specification into a generating function using formal rules, and finally extract the probabilities of interest from the singularities of the generating function. I use this approach to construct simple estimators of the success rate of the seeding heuristic under different types of sequencing errors. I also show how the analytic combinatorics strategy can be used to compute the associated type I and type II error rates (mapping the read to the wrong location, or being unable to map the read). Finally, I show how analytic combinatorics can be used to estimate average quantities such as the expected number of errors in reads where the seeding heuristic fails. Overall, this work introduces a theoretical and practical framework to find the success rate of seeding heuristics and related problems in bioinformatics."},

Bemmels", "Christopher W. Dick"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/205716 ", "abstract": "Aim: Phylogeographic studies of temperate forest taxa often infer complex histories involving population subdivision into distinct refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, temperate forests may have been broadly distributed in southeastern North America during the LGM. We investigate genome-wide genetic structure in two widespread eastern North America tree species to determine if range expansion from a contiguous area or from genetically isolated refugia better explains the postglacial history of trees and forests from this region.  Location: Eastern North America (ENA).  Taxa: Bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis (Wangenh.) K.Koch) and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata (Mill.) K.Koch).  Methods: Genetic diversity and differentiation indices were calculated from >1,000 nuclear SNP loci genotyped in ca. 180 individuals per species sampled across ENA. Genetic structure was investigated using principle component analysis and genetic clustering algorithms. As an additional tool for inference, areas of suitable habitat during the LGM were predicted using species distribution models (SDMs).  Results: Populations across all latitudes showed similar levels of genetic diversity. Most genetic variation was weakly differentiated across ENA, with the exception of an outlier population of Carya ovata in Texas. Genetic structure in each species exhibited an isolation-by-distance pattern. SDMs predicted high LGM habitat suitability over much of the southeastern United States.  Main conclusions: Both hickory species likely survived the LGM in a large region of continuous habitat and recolonized northern areas in a single expanding front that encountered few migration barriers. More complex scenarios, such as forest refugia, need not be invoked to explain genetic structure. The genetically distinct Texas population of Carya ovata could represent a separate glacial refugium, but other explanations are possible. Relative to that of other temperate forest regions, the phylogeographic history of ENA may have been exceptionally simple, involving a northward range shift but without well defined refugia."},

Emerging evidence suggests that the number, affinity and organization of sites play important roles in regulating enhancer output and ultimately gene expression. Here, we investigate how the cis-regulatory logic of a tissue-specific CRE responsible for even-skipped (eve) induction during cardiogenesis organizes the competing inputs of two ETS members, the activator Pointed (Pnt) and the repressor Yan. Using a combination of reporter gene assays and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we show that Yan and Pnt have distinct preferences for affinity of sites. Not only does Yan prefer high affinity sites, but a tandem pair of such sites is necessary and sufficient for Yan to tune Eve expression levels in newly specified cardioblasts and to block ectopic Eve induction and cell fate specification in surrounding progenitors. Mechanistically, the cooperative Yan recruitment promoted by this conserved high affinity ETS pair not only biases Yan-Pnt competition at the specific CRE, but also organizes Yan repressive complexes in 3D across the eve locus. Taken together our results uncover a novel mechanism by which differential interpretation of CRE syntax by a competing repressor-activator pair can confer both specificity and robustness to developmental transitions."},

More recently, another RNA-guided CRISPR endonuclease called Cpf1 was identified and is also being repurposed. Little is known about the kinetics and mechanism of Cpf1 DNA interaction and how sequence mismatches between the DNA target and guide-RNA influence this interaction. We have used single-molecule fluorescence imaging and biochemical assays to characterize DNA interrogation, cleavage, and product release by three Cpf1 orthologues. Like Cas9, Cpf1 initially binds DNA in search of PAM (protospacer-adjacent motif) sequences, verifies the target sequence unidirectionally from the PAM-proximal end and rapidly rejects any targets that lack a PAM or that are poorly matched with the guide-RNA. Cpf1 requires ~17 bp sequence match for both stable binding and cleavage, contrasting it with Cas9 which requires 9 bp for stable binding and ~16 bp for cleavage. Unlike Cas9, which does not release the DNA cleavage products, Cpf1 rapidly releases the PAM-distal cleavage product, but not the PAM-proximal product. Our findings have important implications on Cpf1-based genome engineering and manipulation applications."},

Both right-HS and MRI-negative group presented the poorest visual memory scores. Also right-HS and left-HS had a worse performance in verbal memory compared to controls and MRI-negative groups. Overall, the presence of HS in the left hemisphere had more impact on verbal memory, which was not found when the seizure focus is in the left hemisphere in the absence of HS. MTLE patients presented an intricate pattern of increased and decreased connectivity regardless the presence or side of HS. As expected, hippocampus was less connected than controls in all groups of patients. Although EEGs indicated that 64.5% of MRI-negative patients were lateralized to the left, this group showed activations similar to the right-HS. Patients with left and right-HS presented similar, increased and decreased connectivity in the ipsilateral hemisphere; however, left-HS had abnormal decreased connectivity in the contralateral hemisphere."},

To investigate, we developed Distributed Amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET), an approach to characterize protein nucleation in living cells. DAmFRET exploits a photoconvertible fluorophore and heterogeneous levels of expression to quantify a proteins self-assembly as a function of its concentration in living cells. Using DAmFRET, we characterize dozens of self-assembling proteins, and find that structural complexity produces nucleation barriers that kinetically control the proteins cellular activities. Pathological prion-like proteins tended to form metastable condensates, whereas prions with physiological functions did not. Our results suggest that quinary structure broadly distinguishes the kinetics of subcellular organization, signal propagation, cytoplasmic inheritance, and proteotoxicity."},

Here, a model is proposed that focuses on the interaction between mechanical and muscle costs to account for duty factor in human gaits. It minimizes the activation costs associated with mechanical work or power demand during muscle contraction (whichever is the more demanding). Empirical observations match model predictions using initial muscle parameters over a range of speeds within gaits. However, a better match is achieved, and a better account for the walk-run transition, with tuned muscle parameters. The tuned model is validated with responses in duty factor to walking at a range of imposed, unnatural step frequencies."},

Such variants are widely dispersed, though concentrated near genes expressed in the brain, and it has been proposed that these SNP associations result from impacts on cell regulatory networks which ultimately affect the expression or function of a modest number of \"core\" genes. A previous study demonstrated association of some GWAS-significant variants with expression of a number of genes, by examining pair-wise correlations of gene expression with SNP genotypes. The present study used data downloaded from the CommonMind Consortium site, consisting of SNP genotypes and RNAseq expression data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, to examine whether the expression of individual genes or sets of genes correlated with PRS in 207 controls and 209 schizophrenia cases. Although the PRS was significantly associated with phenotype, the correlations with genes and genes sets followed distributions expected by chance. Thus, this analysis failed to demonstrate that the PRS captures a cumulative effect of multiple variants impacting the expression of a small number of genes and it failed to focus attention on a small number of genes of biological relevance. The multiple SNP associations observed in schizophrenia may result from other mechanisms, including effects mediated indirectly through environmental risk factors."},

These simple forms of behavioral plasticity are due in part to changes in gene expression and neuronal properties. Surprisingly little is known about how ethanol initiates changes in gene expression or what the changes do. Here we demonstrate a role in ethanol plasticity for Hr38, the sole Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Nr4a1/2/3 class of immediate early response transcription factors. Acute ethanol exposure induces transient expression of Hr38 and other immediate early neuronal activity genes. Ethanol activates the Mef2 transcriptional activator to induce Hr38, and the Sirt1 histone/protein deacetylase terminates Hr38 induction. Loss of Hr38 decreases ethanol tolerance and causes precocious but short-lasting ethanol preference. Similarly, reduced Mef2 activity in all neurons or specifically in the mushroom body \u03b1/\u03b2 neurons decreases ethanol tolerance; Sirt1 promotes ethanol tolerance in these same neurons. Genetically decreasing Hr38 expression levels in Sirt1 null mutants restores ethanol tolerance, demonstrating that both induction and termination of Hr38 expression are important for behavioral plasticity to proceed. These data demonstrate that Hr38 functions as an immediate early transcription factor that promotes ethanol behavioral plasticity."},

The swings (oscillations) mark the length of an episode in a patients mood cycle (period), and can vary from hours to years. The proposed modeling study uses decision making framework to investigate the role of basal ganglia network in generating bipolar oscillations. In this model, the basal ganglia system performs a two-arm bandit task in which one of the arms leads to a positive outcome, while the other leads to a negative outcome. In healthy conditions, the model chooses positive action and avoids negative one, whereas under bipolar conditions, the model exhibits slow oscillations in its choice of positive or negative outcomes, reminiscent of bipolar oscillations. The model is cast at three levels of abstraction: 1) a two-dimensional dynamical system model, 2) a phenomenological basal ganglia model, 3) a detailed network model of basal ganglia. Phase-plane analyses on the simple reduced dynamical system with two variables reveal the essential parameters that generate pathological bipolar-like oscillations. Phenomenological and network models of the basal ganglia extend that logic, and interpret bipolar oscillations in terms of the activity of dopaminergic and serotonergic projections on the cortico-basal ganglia network dynamics. The network dysfunction, specifically in terms of reward and risk sensitivity, is shown to be responsible for the pathological bipolar oscillations. The study proposes a computational model that explores the effects of impaired serotonergic neuromodulation on the dynamics of the cortico basal ganglia network, and relates this impairment to abstract mood states (manic and depressive episodes) and oscillations of bipolar disorder."},

When exposed to potentially lethal human actions, such as hunting or fishing, fish and wildlife is expected to behaviorally respond by becoming more timid, but proving such responses underwater in the wild has been challenging. Using a rich dataset collected in situ, we provide evidence of spearfishing-induced behavioral effects in five coastal fish species using the flight initiation distance (FID) as a proxy of predator avoidance and boldness. We document that spearfishing promotes a timidity syndrome (i.e., an increase of the average timidity of harvested populations) and that the  wariness of preys is influenced by individual size, level of protection offered through marine protected areas and the ability to recognize the risk posed by underwater human predators. In particular, we show that changes in the appearance of the observer (spearfisher vs. snorkeler) modulate the risk perception among the exploited species, and these differences are more evident outside marine protected areas where spearfishing is allowed. We also detected a positive correlation between FID and fish size, with larger specimens (that are more likely targets of spearfishers) revealing larger FID. The behavioral effects were most clearly expressed in the most heavily exploited species and declined towards the less desired and less targeted ones, which may be a result of learning mechanisms and plasticity and/or fisheries-induced evolution of timidity. Our study reveals a trade-off where intensive spearfishing negatively affects future spearfishing success through behavior-based alteration of catchability. Either rotating harvest or implementation of mosaics of protected and exploited areas might be needed to manage spearfishing-induced timidity in exploited stocks."},

Gain of HDAC7 function in thymocytes blocks both negative selection and NKT development, diverting these cells into a Tconv-like lineage. Conversely, HDAC7 deletion promotes thymocyte apoptosis and causes aberrant expansion of innate-effector cells. Investigating the mechanisms involved, we found that HDAC7 binds PLZF and modulates PLZF-dependent transcription. Moreover, HDAC7 and many of its transcriptional targets are human risk loci for IBD and PSC, autoimmune diseases that strikingly resemble the disease we observe in HDAC7 gain-of-function in mice. Importantly, reconstitution of iNKT cells in these mice abrogated their disease, suggesting that interaction between the defects in negative selection and iNKT cells caused by altered HDAC7 function can cause tissue-restricted autoimmunity, a finding that may explain the association between HDAC7 and hepatobiliary autoimmunity."},

Nevertheless, such a peptidoglycan-inducible pathway seemed not to be a front-line defense system because of the long lag time. Here I report a faster immune priming, which can be triggered by an injection of gelatin, that confers a complete infection resistance to silkworms within two hours. Gelatin-injected silkworms showed 100% viability in a lethal dose of a Gram-negative bacterial infection. The effect became apparent within two hours after the gelatin injection. Whereas, an injection of non-gelatin protein (bovine serum albumin) solution did not induce such reaction. These results suggest that the silkworm possesses a fast and gelatin-inducible pathway that confers infection resistance to Gram-negative bacteria, which may act as a front-line defense. This finding highlights the potency of gelatin as a tool for investigating the primed immune responses in insect species."},

Verticillium longisporum mainly infects brassicaceous hosts, including oilseed rape. The most conspicuous symptom of V. longisporum infection on oilseed rape is black stem striping that appears towards the end of the cropping season. Thus far, the impact of V. longisporum infection on oilseed yield remains unclear. Verticillium stem striping recently emerged as a new disease in UK and currently displays a widespread occurrence in England. In this study, we assessed the impact of Verticillium stem striping on British oilseed rape production. To this end, four cultivars (Incentive, Vision, Harper and Quartz) were grown in field plots with different levels of V. longisporum disease pressure at different locations over two consecutive years. Whereas Incentive and Vision developed relatively few stem striping symptoms, Harper and especially Quartz showed severe symptoms during these field experiments. Furthermore, higher inoculum levels induced more severe symptoms in these cultivars. Intriguingly, significant yield reductions upon V. longisporum infection only occurred in a single field trial on all tested oilseed rape cultivars. Thus we conclude that Verticillium stem striping does not consistently impact oilseed rape yield, despite the occurrence of abundant disease symptoms."},

However, the current network modeling literature lacks a general framework for analyzing functional connectivity (FC) networks in fMRI data obtained from a longitudinal study. In this work, we build a novel longitudinal FC network model using a variance components approach. First, for all subjects' visits, we account for the autocorrelation inherent in the fMRI time series data using a non-parametric technique. Second, we use a generalized least squares approach to estimate 1) the within-subject variance component shared across the population, 2) the FC network, and 3) the FC network's longitudinal trend. Our novel method for longitudinal FC networks seeks to account for the within-subject dependence across multiple visits, the variability due to the subjects being sampled from a population, and the autocorrelation present in fMRI data, while restricting the number of parameters in order to make the method computationally feasible and stable. We develop a permutation testing procedure to draw valid inference on group differences in baseline FC and change in FC over time between a set of patients and a comparable set of controls. To examine performance, we run a series of simulations and apply the model to longitudinal fMRI data collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database."},

Holland", "Margaret E. Johnson"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/205674 ", "abstract": "Stoichiometric balance, or dosage balance, implies that proteins that are subunits of obligate complexes (e.g. the ribosome) should have copy numbers expressed to match their stoichiometry in that complex. Establishing balance (or imbalance) is an important tool for inferring subunit function and assembly bottlenecks. We show here that these correlations in protein copy numbers can extend beyond complex subunits to larger protein-protein interactions networks (PPIN) involving a range of reversible binding interactions. We develop a simple method for quantifying balance in any interface-resolved PPINs based on network structure and experimentally observed protein copy numbers. By analyzing such a network for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) system in yeast, we found that the real protein copy numbers were significantly more balanced in relation to their binding partners compared to randomly sampled sets of yeast copy numbers. The observed balance is not perfect, highlighting both under and overexpressed proteins. We evaluate the potential cost and benefits of imbalance using two criteria. First, a potential cost to imbalance is that leftover proteins without remaining functional partners are free to misinteract. We systematically quantify how this misinteraction cost is most dangerous for strong-binding protein interactions and for network topologies observed in biological PPINs. Second, a more direct consequence of imbalance is that the formation of specific functional complexes depends on relative copy numbers. We therefore construct simple kinetic models of two sub-networks in the CME network to assess multi-protein assembly of the ARP2/3 complex and a minimal, nine-protein clathrin-coated vesicle forming module. We find that the observed, imperfectly balanced copy numbers are less effective than balanced copy numbers in producing fast and complete multi-protein assemblies. However, we speculate that strategic imbalance in the vesicle forming module allows cells to tune where endocytosis occurs, providing sensitive control over cargo uptake via clathrin-coated vesicles."},

The IOP data will be subjected to conventional quantitative trait analysis using simple and composite interval mapping along with epistatic interactions to define genomic loci modulating normal IOP.  Results: The analysis defined one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on Chr.8 (100 to 106 Mb). The significant locus was further examined to define candidate genes that modulate normal IOP. There are only two good candidate genes within the 6 Mb over the peak, Cdh8 (Cadherin 8) and Cdh11 (Cadherin 11). Expression analysis on gene expression and immunohistochemistry indicate that Cdh11 is the best candidate for modulating the normal levels of IOP.  Conclusions: We have examined the genomic regulation of IOP in the BXD RI strain set and found one significant QTL on Chr. 8. Within this QTL that are two potential candidates for modulating IOP with the most likely gene being Cdh11."},

Here we use a combination of genetic and cytological approaches to show that while XX females undergo conventional meiosis to produce mostly haplo-X oocytes, hermaphrodites undergo atypical meiosis to produce nullo-X oocytes and mostly diplo-X sperm. Gender- and gamete-specific alterations of the normal meiotic program include non-pairing of the X homologs and precocious separation of X chromatids.

Local interruption of measles transmission, however, requires sustained high levels of population immunity that can be challenging to achieve and maintain. The herd immunity threshold for measles is typically stipulated at 90-95%. This figure, however, does not easily translate into required immunity levels across all age groups that would be sufficient to interrupt transmission. Previous estimates of such levels were based on speculative contact patterns based on historical data from high-income countries. The aim of this study was to determine age-specific immunity levels that would ensure elimination of measles using observed contact patterns from a broad range of settings. We combined recent observations on age-specific mixing patterns with scenarios for the distribution of immunity to estimate transmission potential. We validated these models by deriving predictions based on serological studies and comparing them to observed case data. We found that 95% immunity needs to be achieved at the time of school entry to guarantee elimination. The level of immunity found in the 5-to-9 year old age group in serological studies was the strongest predictor of future case load. Higher levels of immunity in 5-to-9 year olds are required than the previously derived target of 90% to interrupt transmission. While such high levels can be difficult to achieve, school entry provides a clear opportunity to ensure sufficient levels of immunity."},

Humans routinely solve problems that appear to require structured representations of stimulus properties and relations. Answering the question of how we acquire these representations has central importance in an account of human cognition. We propose a theory of how a system can learn invariant responses to instances of similarity and relative magnitude, and how structured relational representations can be learned from initially unstructured inputs. We instantiate that theory in the DORA (Discovery of Relations by Analogy) computational framework. The result is a system that learns structured representations of relations from unstructured flat feature vector representations of objects with absolute properties. The resulting representations meet the requirements of human structured relational representations, and the model captures several specific phenomena from the literature on cognitive development. In doing so, we address a major limitation of current accounts of cognition, and provide an existence proof for how structured representations might be learned from experience."},

The development of a method for measuring the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface, and changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which are specific to each receptor, are used as an index of the receptor activity. Here, we show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing GPCR activity. We monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrates that changes in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflect the ligand-dependent activity. Then, we reveal that the diffusion of receptor molecules is altered by the common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding or accumulation in clathrin-coated pits, by inhibitor assay and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis. We also confirm the general applicability of the method to class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that the diffusion coefficient is a good index for estimating the activities of many GPCRs regardless of the phylogenetic groups, chemical properties of the ligands, and G protein-coupling selectivity."},

Remarkably, this leads to an expansion of the repertoire of active brain states, suggestive of a general re-organization of brain dynamics given the non-random increase in co-activation across frequencies. Interestingly, the frequency distribution of the active repertoire of brain states under LSD closely follows power-laws indicating a re-organization of the dynamics at the edge of criticality.

We also introduced a method to explore the relative importance of residues with respect to the overall deformation that it causes to the overall structure in an evolutionary time scale. We found that the GH13 family can be classified into three main structural groups. There is a hierarchical structure within these clusters that can be use to inform other classification schemes. We also found that by using structural information, subtle structural shifts can be identified and that can be missed in sequence/phylogeny-only based classifications. When each structural group is explored, we found that identifying the most structurally variable sites can lead to identification of functionally (both catalytically and structurally) important residues."},

Instead, molecular dynamics simulations and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments show that phosphorylation profoundly alters the structure and dynamics of the DFG-In subpopulation, leading to activation of the kinase.

To better understand this process we monitored genome-wide temporal and spatial gene expression changes in grafted Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls. Tissues above and below the graft rapidly developed an asymmetry such that many genes were more highly expressed on one side than the other. This asymmetry correlated with sugar responsive genes and we observed an accumulation of starch above the graft that decreased along with asymmetry once the sugar-transporting vascular tissues reconnected. Despite the initial starvation response below the graft, many genes associated with vascular formation were rapidly activated in grafted tissues but not in cut and separated tissues indicating that a recognition mechanism activated that was independent of functional vascular connections. Auxin which is transported cell-to-cell, had a rapidly elevated response that was symmetric, suggesting that auxin was perceived by the root within hours of tissue attachment to activate the vascular regeneration process. A subset of genes were expressed only in grafted tissues, indicating that wound healing proceeded via different mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of adjoining tissues. Such a recognition process could have broader relevance for tissue regeneration, inter-tissue communication and tissue fusion events."},

These results are consistent with immune modulating properties of certain probiotics based on the fermentation of milk and colostrum. Urinary excretion of non-metal toxicants that accumulate in adipose tissue such as Perchlorate, N-acetyl(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine (NAHP), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), N-acetyl phenyl cysteine (NAP), Phenylglycoxylic acid (PGO), Monoethylphthalate (MEP) and 2-Hydroxyisobutyric Acid (2HIB) was significantly increased. These results are consistent with the weight loss (5 Kg) associated with intermittent fasting and with the known features of probiotics as detoxification tools. Consistent with certain toxicants acting as endocrine disruptors, we observed an increased elimination of toxicants and a 33% decrease of serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), suggesting a trend toward normalization of thyroid function. These results support the hypothesis that a combination of intermittent fasting with the consumption of specific probiotic yogurts may lead to immune modulation, detoxification and other improvements."},

In our second experiment, participants grasped the robot handle with their thumb pointing upward, but the cursor's movement was either veridical, or was mirrored such that flexing the wrist moved the cursor as if the participant extended their wrist, and vice versa.

Each population displayed extremely low genetic diversity, consistent with extremely small effective size (\u226492 individuals). Habitat degradation and distribution gaps correlated with highly asymmetric gene-flow that was inefficient in maintaining connectivity between populations. Genetic inferences of historical demography revealed that the populations in the Yangtze descended from a small number of founders colonizing the river from the sea during the last Ice Age. The colonization was followed by a rapid population split during the last millennium predating the Chinese Modern Economy Development.

Association summary statistics from genome-wide meta-analyses are available for hundreds of traits. Updating these to ever-increasing reference panels is very cumbersome as it requires reimputation of the genetic data, rerunning the association scan, and meta-analysing the results. A much more efficient method is to directly impute the summary statistics, termed as summary statistics imputation. Its performance relative to genotype imputation and practical utility has not yet been fully investigated. To this end, we compared the two approaches on real (genotyped and imputed) data from 120K samples from the UK Biobank and show that, while genotype imputation boasts a 2- to 5-fold lower root-mean-square error, summary statistics imputation better distinguishes true associations from null ones: We observed the largest differences in power for variants with low minor allele frequency and low imputation quality. For fixed false positive rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, using summary statistics imputation yielded an increase in statistical power by 15, 10 and 3%, respectively. To test its capacity to discover novel associations, we applied summary statistics imputation to the GIANT height meta-analysis summary statistics covering HapMap variants, and identified 34 novel loci, 19 of which replicated using data in the UK Biobank. Additionally, we successfully replicated 55 out of the 111 variants published in an exome chip study.

The way the pulvinar interacts with cortex is governed by its intrinsic organization. Here, we show using fMRI that the human pulvinar is functionally heterogeneous, broadly separated into dorsal and ventral subdivisions based on characterization of response properties and functional connectivity with cortex. These differences mirrored the organization of the dorsal and ventral streams of visual cortex. The ventral subdivision of the pulvinar was functionally coupled with occipital and temporal cortex. The dorsal subdivision of the pulvinar was functionally coupled with frontal and parietal cortex. The dorsal subdivision was also coupled with the human-specific tool network and to the default mode network. The spatial organization of pulvino-cortical coupling reflected both the functional similarities and anatomical  distances between cortical areas. Together, the human pulvinar appears to represent the entire visual system and the principles that govern its organization, though in a spatially compressed form."},

Dispersal of individuals among the remaining fragments may be critical to allow populations of forest-dependent to persist. In SE Asia, conversion of forests to oil palm agriculture is a particular threat. Many oil-palm dominated landscapes retain forested riparian reserves along streams and rivers, providing potential dispersal corridors to link forest fragments. However the extent to which these riparian reserves are used for dispersal, relative to the oil palm matrix, is poorly understood. We used mark-release-recapture methods to investigate the dispersal behaviour of forest-dependent moths and dung beetles in riparian reserves within oil palm dominated landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We found that moth dispersal was largely unaffected by habitat type and by habitat boundaries, although dispersal distances were significantly higher within riparian reserves than elsewhere. In contrast, dung beetle dispersal responded strongly to habitat type and boundaries. Dung beetles preferentially used riparian reserves to move in and out of forest, and only two dung beetle taxa, Catharsius sp. and O. obscurior, were found to disperse from forest and riparian reserves into oil palm. Dispersal behaviours were not clearly associated with the life history traits of individual species. Our results suggest that, even if riparian reserves are unable to support viable populations of forest-dependent invertebrate species, they may provide valuable dispersal corridors through oil palm plantations, strengthening the case for their retention and re-establishment."},

The current study attempts to help clarify the relationship between resting heart rate and psychopathic traits in a large, nationally representative sample using an alternative measure of psychopathic traits that is less focused on antisocial processes. No significant relationship between heart rate and psychopathic traits, or heart rate and a measure of cold heartedness, was found after controlling for age, sex, and race.

For many years, it was thought that multisensory integration in the cerebral cortex only occurs in high-level \"polysensory\" association areas, but recent studies have demonstrated cross-modal influences in regions that were traditionally designated as unimodal. In particular, several human neuroimaging studies have reported that extrastriate areas involved in visual motion perception are also activated by auditory motion, and may integrate audio-visual motion cues. However, the exact nature and extent of the effects of auditory motion on the visual cortex have not been studied at the single neuron level. We recorded the spiking activity of neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anesthetized marmoset monkeys upon presentation of unimodal stimuli (moving auditory or visual patterns), as well as bimodal stimuli (concurrent audio-visual motion). Despite robust, direction selective responses to visual motion, none of the sampled neurons responded to auditory motion stimuli. Moreover, concurrent moving auditory stimuli had no significant effect on the ability of single MT and MST neurons, or populations of simultaneously recorded neurons, to discriminate the direction of motion of visual stimuli (moving random dot patterns with varying levels of motion noise). Our findings suggest that MT and MST neurons do not process or integrate moving auditory cues."},

We introduce a new methodological framework for defining a combinatorial epigenomic model of chromatin state on a web database, StateHub. In addition, we created an annotation tool for bioconductor, StatePaintR, which accesses these models and uses them to rapidly (on the order of seconds) produce chromatin state segmentations in standard genome browser formats. Annotations are fully documented with change history and versioning, authorship information, and original source files. StatePaintR calculates ranks for each state from next-gen sequencing peak statistics, facilitating variant prioritization, enrichment testing, and other types of quantitative analysis. StateHub hosts annotation tracks for major public consortia as a resource, and allows users to submit their own alternative models."},

Ear canal microphone measurements in humans (n=19 ears in 16 subjects) and monkeys (n=5 ears in 3 subjects) performing a saccadic eye movement task to visual targets indicated that the eardrum moves in conjunction with the eye movement. The eardrum motion was oscillatory and began as early as 10 ms before saccade onset in humans or with saccade onset in monkeys. These eardrum movements, which we dub Eye Movement Related Eardrum Oscillations (EMREOs), occurred in the absence of a sound stimulus. The EMREOs' amplitude and phase depended on the direction and horizontal amplitude of the saccade.  They lasted throughout the saccade and well into subsequent periods of steady fixation.  We discuss the possibility that the mechanisms underlying EMREOs create eye movement-related binaural cues that may aid the brain in evaluating the relationship between visual and auditory stimulus locations as the eyes move."},

These findings are problematic for current models of sensorimotor adaptation, and point to a new theoretical perspective in which learning is constrained by the size of the error correction, rather than sensitivity to error."},

Here, we tested the effect of ivermectin (IVM), a chloride channel opener drug commonly used to combat heart worms, on regeneration in a new species of planaria: D. dorotocephala. Exposure to IVM during regeneration resulted in patterning abnormalities, such as bifurcated tails with partial heads, as well as delayed regeneration. By testing the effect of drugs that target resting potential on regenerative repair in novel model species, additional insight is gained on the comparative roles of ionic signaling across taxa."},

Several studies using the Tic Suppression Task have demonstrated significant inter-individual variability in tic suppressibility but have individually been underpowered to address correlates of tic suppression. The present study explored patterns and clinical correlates of tic suppression in youth with tic disorders using a large, pooled dataset.  Methods: Individual-level data from 9 studies using the Tic Suppression Task were pooled, yielding a sample of 99 youth with tic disorders. Analyses examined patterns of tic suppressibility and the relationship between tic suppressibility and demographic and clinical characteristics.  Results: A large majority of youth demonstrated a high degree of tic suppression, but heterogeneous patterns of tic suppressibility were also observed. Better tic suppressibility was related to older age and more frequent tics but unrelated to other clinical variables, including presence of psychiatric comorbidity, psychotropic medication status, and tic and premonitory urge severity.  Conclusions: The mechanisms underlying the observed heterogeneity in tic suppressibility warrant further investigation. The Tic Suppression Task is a promising method for testing mechanistic hypotheses related to tic suppression."},

In a recent study, we suggested a third pathway for SA biosynthesis from mandelonitrile (MD) in peach plants. This pathway is alternative to the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway and links SA biosynthesis and cyanogenesis. In the present work, we show that this new SA biosynthetic pathway is also functional under abiotic (salt) and biotic (Plum pox virus infection) stress conditions, although the contribution of this pathway to the SA pool does not seem to be important under such conditions. Treating peach plants with MD not only affected the SA content, but it also had a pleiotropic effect on abscisic acid and jasmonic acid levels, two well-known stress related hormones, as well as on the H2O2-related antioxidant activities. Furthermore, MD improved plant performance under the stressful conditions, probably via the activation of different signaling pathways. We have thus proven that SA is not limited to biotic stress responses, but that it also plays a role in the response to abiotic stress in peach, although the physiological functions of this new SA biosynthetic pathway from MD remain to be elucidated."},

We hypothesize that immunological signaling in the developing brain, notably the complement cascade underlying microglial synaptic pruning, could be one mechanism for this dimorphism. Here we show that genes differentially expressed between male and female normal cortical development are enriched for pathways associated with the activation of the innate immune system, complement cascade and phagocytic processes. Specifically, the male brain is enriched for the expression of genes associated with phagocytic function of microglia through complement-dependent synaptic pruning especially at the developmental stages before birth. Our results suggest the existence of a common regulatory module involved in both prenatal immune activation in males and postnatal immune activation in females. The activation of immune pruning pathways at different stages of normal male and female development could provide valuable insights about critical periods of plasticity and refinement in the human cortex that could explain the different vulnerabilities of males and females to neurological disorders."},

Methods: Patients with shrimp sensitization (positive skin prick test [SPT] and/or sIgE) with/without history of clinical reaction were recruited. Allergy was confirmed by oral food challenge (OFC) except for patients with history of anaphylaxis. Shrimp allergic (SA) and shrimp tolerant (ST) patients were further classified based on HDM sensitivity. The sIgE to shrimp, shrimp and HDM components were performed. Fishers exact test, Wilcoxon sum rank test and receiver operating characteristics analyses were done.  Results: Of 79 patients recruited, 12 SA (7 positive OFC and 5 with history of anaphylaxis), 18 ST and 10 non-shrimp sensitized controls (NC) were enrolled. In non-HDM sensitized patients, sIgE to shrimp (10.5 kUA/L, p=0.012) and Der p 10 (4.09 kUA/L, p=0.035) were higher in SA patients.

Yet given the limited penetrance of this genetic variant, it is necessary to individually predict the risk of hyperhomocysteinemia for a rs1801133 carrier. \nObjective: We hypothesized that variability of this genetic risk is largely due to the presence of factors (covariates) that serve as effect modifiers and/or confounders, such as folic acid (FA) intake, and aimed to assess this risk in the complex context of these covariates.\nDesign: We systematically extracted from published studies the data of tHcy, rs1801133, and any previously reported rs1801133 covariates. The resulting meta-dataset was first used to analyze the covariates\u2032 modifying effect by meta regression and other statistical means.

The effect of rs1801133 on tHcy exhibits significant variability that can be attributed to effect modification and, to a larger degree, confounding by these covariates. Via statistical modeling, we predicted the covariate-dependent risk of tHcy elevation and hyperhomocysteinemia in a systematic manner.\nConclusions: we demonstrated an evidence-based approach that globally assesses the covariate-dependent effect of rs1801133 on tHcy. The results should assist clinicians in interpreting the rs1801133 data from genetic testing for their patients. Such information is also important for the public that increasingly receives genetic data from commercial services without interpretation of its clinical relevance."},

However, it is limited by ambiguous metabolite identifications. Furthermore, interpretation is limited by incomplete and inaccurate genome-based predictions of enzyme activities (i.e. gene annotations). Metabolite, Annotation, and Gene Integration (MAGI) addresses these challenges by generating metabolite-gene associations via biochemical reactions based on a score between probable metabolite identifications and probable gene annotations. This is calculated by a Bayesian-like method and emphasizes consensus between metabolites and genes. We applied MAGI to sequence data and metabolomics data collected from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), an extensively characterized bacterium that produces diverse secondary metabolites. We found that coupling metabolomics and genomics data by scoring consensus between the two increases the quality of both metabolite identifications and gene annotations. Moreover, MAGI was found to make correct biochemical predictions for poorly annotated genes that were readily validated by literature searches. As metabolomics data become more widely available for sequenced organisms, this approach has the potential to improve our understanding of microbial metabolism while also providing testable hypotheses for specific biochemical functions.

Dual learning mechanisms suggests that feedback signals have a multifaceted impact on BG-dependent decisions. Using a hybrid of accumulation-to-bound decision models and reinforcement learning, we modeled the performance of humans in a stop-signal task where participants (N=75) learned the prior distribution of the timing of a stop signal through trial-and-error feedback. Changes in the drift-rate of the action execution process were driven by errors in action timing, whereas adaptation in the boundary height served to increase caution following failed stops. These findings highlight two interactive learning mechanisms for adapting the control of goal-directed actions based on dissociable dimensions of feedback error."},

Essentially nothing is known about its biogenesis, including the location of its promoter. A prevailing assumption has been that ciRS-7 is an exceptional circRNA because it is transcribed from a locus lacking any mature linear RNA transcripts of the same sense. Our interest in the biogenesis of ciRS-7 led us to develop an algorithm to define its promoter. This approach predicted that the human ciRS-7 promoter coincides with that of the long non-coding RNA, LINC00632. We validated this prediction using multiple orthogonal experimental assays. We also used computational approaches and experimental validation to establish that ciRS-7 exonic sequence is embedded in linear transcripts that are flanked by cryptic exons in both human and mouse. Together, this experimental and computational evidence generate a new view of regulation in this locus: (a) ciRS-7 is like other circRNAs, as it is spliced into linear transcripts; (b) expression of ciRS-7 is primarily determined by the chromatin state of LINC00632 promoters; (c) transcription and splicing factors sufficient for ciRS-7 biogenesis are expressed in cells that lack detectable ciRS-7 expression.

In neurophysiology experiments, information about external stimuli or behavioral tasks has been frequently characterized in term of neuronal firing rate. The firing rate is conventionally estimated by averaging spiking responses across multiple similar experiments (or trials). However, there exist a number of applications in neuroscience research that require firing rate to be estimated on a single trial basis. Estimating firing rate from a single trial is a challenging problem and current state-of-the-art methods do not perform well. To address this issue, we develop a new method for estimating firing rate based on kernel smoothing technique that considers the bandwidth as a random variable with prior distribution that is adaptively updated under a Bayesian framework. By carefully selecting the prior distribution together with Gaussian kernel function, an analytical expression can be achieved for the kernel bandwidth. We refer to the proposed method as Bayesian Adaptive Kernel Smoother (BAKS). We evaluate the performance of BAKS using synthetic spike train data generated by biologically plausible models: inhomogeneous Gamma (IG) and inhomogeneous inverse Gaussian (IIG). We also apply BAKS to real spike train data from non-human primate (NHP) motor and visual cortex. We benchmark the proposed method against the established and previously reported methods. These include: optimized kernel smoother (OKS), variable kernel smoother (VKS), local polynomial fit (Locfit), and Bayesian adaptive regression splines (BARS). Results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to competing methods. This suggests that the proposed method could be useful for understanding the encoding mechanism of neurons in cognitive-related tasks. The proposed method could also potentially improve the performance of brain-machine interface (BMI) decoder that relies on estimated firing rate as the input."},

Pilot clinical studies suggest that rapid failure of the miniaturized neural implants in the body presents a major challenge for this type of technology. Miniaturization imposes stricter requirements for reliability of materials and designs. Evaluation of neural implant performance over clinically relevant timescales presents time- and cost-prohibitive challenges for animal models.  Approach: In vitro reactive accelerated aging (RAA) was developed to expedite durability testing of these devices. RAA simulates an aggressive physiological environment associated with an immune response and implicated in device failure. It uses hydrogen peroxide, which mimics reactive oxygen species (ROS), and high temperature to accelerate chemical reactions that lead to device degradation. RAA accurately simulates the degradation pattern of neural implants observed in vivo, but requires daily maintenance and is prone to variability in performance.  Main results: This work introduces automated reactive accelerated aging (aRAA) that is compatible with multiplexing. The core of aRAA is electrochemical detection for feedback control of hydrogen peroxide concentration, implemented with simple off-the shelf components.  Significance: aRAA allows multiple parallel experiments for a high-throughput optimization of reactive aging conditions to more quickly and more rigorously simulate the in vivo environment. aRAA is a cost-effective tool for rapid in vitro evaluation of durability of neural implants, ultimately expediting the development of a new generation of miniaturized devices with long functional lifespans."},

Despite the recent progress in understanding protein hunger and satiety in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, how fruit flies assess prospective dietary protein sources and ensure protein consumption remains elusive. We show here that three specific amino acids, L-glutamate (L-Glu), L-alanine (L-Ala), and L-aspartate (L-Asp), rapidly promote food consumption in fruit flies when present in food. The effect of dietary amino acids to promote food consumption is independent of mating experience and internal nutritional status. Genetic analysis identifies six brain neurons expressing diuretic hormone 44 (DH44) as a sensor of dietary amino acids. DH44+ neurons can be directly activated by these three amino acids, and are both necessary and sufficient for dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. By conducting single cell RNAseq analysis, we also identify an amino acid transporter, CG13248, which is highly expressed in DH44+ neurons and is required for dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. Therefore, these data suggest that dietary amino acids may enter DH44+ neurons via CG13248 and modulate their activity and hence food consumption. Taken together, these data identify an internal amino acid sensor in the fly brain that evaluate food sources post-ingestively and facilitates adequate protein intake."},

In our previous work (Andreev, O'Connor et al. 2015), we demonstrated that most human mRNAs resistant to this inhibition possess translated uORFs and in some cases a single uORF is sufficient for the resistance. Here we developed a computational model of Initiation Complexes Interference with Elongating Ribosomes (ICIER) to gain insight into the mechanism. We explored the relationship between the flux of scanning ribosomes upstream and downstream of a single uORF depending on uORF features. Paradoxically our analysis predicts that reducing ribosome flux upstream of certain uORFs increases initiation downstream. The model reveals derepression of downstream translation as general mechanism of uORF-mediated stress resistance. It predicts that stress resistance can be achieved with long or slowly translated uORFs that do not favor high levels of translation re-initiation \u00a0and start with non-leaky initiators."},

Assuming a linear model linking the markers to the outcome, this article proposes an estimator of the heritability of the trait, defined here as the fraction of the variance of the trait explained by the genomic markers in the study. The estimator, called GWAS heritability (GWASH) estimator, is easy to compute, highly interpretable, and is consistent as the number of markers and the sample size increase. More importantly, it can be computed from summary statistics typically reported in GWAS, not requiring access to the original data. The estimator takes full account of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) or correlation between the SNPs in the study through moments of the LD matrix, estimable from auxiliary datasets. Unlike other proposed estimators in the literature, the precision of the estimate is obtainable analytically, allowing for power and sample size calculations for heritability estimates."},

New methods are urgently required to provide functional insights into pathogens from the massive genomic data sets now being generated from routine pathogen surveillance for epidemiological purposes. Here we integrate a method for scoring the functional impact of mutations with a random forest classifier, and apply this to the classification of Salmonella enterica strains associated with extraintestinal disease. Members of the species fall along a continuum, from pathovars which cause gastrointestinal infection and low mortality, associated with a broad host-range, to those that cause invasive infection and high mortality, associated with a narrowed host range. By training our random forest classifier to discriminate gastrointestinal and invasive serovars of Salmonella, using a small and well-characterised training dataset, we are able to additionally discriminate recently emerged Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium lineages associated with invasive disease in immunocompromised populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Importantly, our classifier produces interpretable lists of gene variants associated with extraintestinal disease. This approach accurately identifies patterns of gene degradation specific to invasive serovars that have been captured by more labour-intensive investigations, but can be readily scaled to larger analyses."},

However, concerns over patient re-identification from these data lead to questions about how tightly access should be controlled. It is not thought to be possible to re-identify patients from somatic variant data. However, somatic variant detection pipelines can mistakenly identify germline variants as somatic ones, a process called \"germline leakage\". The rate of germline leakage across different somatic variant detection pipelines is not well-understood, and it is uncertain whether or not somatic variant calls should be considered re-identifiable. To fill this gap, we quantified germline leakage across 259 sets of whole-genome somatic single nucleotide variant (SNVs) predictions made by 21 teams as part of the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge.  Results: The median somatic SNV prediction set contained 4,325 somatic SNVs and leaked one germline polymorphism. The level of germline leakage was inversely correlated with somatic SNV prediction accuracy and positively correlated with the amount of infiltrating normal cells. The specific germline variants leaked differed by tumour and algorithm. To aid in quantitation and correction of leakage, we created a tool, called GermlineFilter, for use in public-facing somatic SNV databases.  Conclusions: The potential for patient re-identification from leaked germline variants in somatic SNV predictions has led to divergent open data access policies, based on different assessments of the risks. Indeed, a single, well-publicized re-identification event could reshape public perceptions of the values of genomic data sharing. We find that modern somatic SNV prediction pipelines have low germline-leakage rates, which can be further reduced, especially for cloud-sharing, using pre-filtering software."},

However, the relationship between developmental and adult neurogenesis has not been studied in detail.

We found clearly distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell types, linked by transient intermediate states to neuroblast stages and fully mature granule cells. The molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial glia shifted after postnatal day 5, and was then maintained through postnatal and adult stages. A similar shift was observed for granule cells at P20. In contrast, intermediate progenitor cells, neuroblasts and immature granule cells were nearly indistinguishable at all ages. These findings demonstrate the fundamental continunity of postnatal and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and pinpoint the early postnatal transformation of radial glia from embryonic progenitors to adult quiescent stem cells."},

Additionally, it was recently shown that more than 200 diseases are known to be linked to variants in mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes interacting with mitochondria. This has reinvigorated interest in its biology and population genetics. Mitochondrial heteroplasmy, or genotypic variation of mitochondria within an individual, is now understood to be common in humans and important in human health. However, it is still not possible to make quantitative predictions about the inheritance of heteroplasmy and its proliferation within the body, partly due to the lack of an appropriate model. Here, we present a population-genetic framework for modeling mitochondrial heteroplasmy as a process that occurs on an ontogenetic phylogeny, with genetic drift and mutation changing heteroplasmy frequencies during the various developmental processes represented in the phylogeny. Using this framework, we develop a Bayesian inference method for inferring rates of mitochondrial genetic drift and mutation at different stages of human life. Applying the method to previously published heteroplasmy frequency data, we demonstrate a severe effective germline bottleneck comprised of the cumulative genetic drift occurring between the divergence of germline and somatic cells in the mother and the separation of germ layers in the offspring. Additionally, we find that the two somatic tissues we analyze here undergo tissue-specific bottlenecks during embryogenesis, less severe than the effective germline bottleneck, and that these somatic tissues experience little additional genetic drift during adulthood. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of the ontogenetic phylogeny framework and its possible applications to other ontogenetic processes in addition to mitochondrial heteroplasmy."},

In contrast to previous studies based on mRNA expression or protein abundance, we found that a set of TFs binding to only around ten distinct motifs display strong DNA-binding activity in any given cell or tissue type. Mass spectrometric identification of TFs revealed that within these highly active TFs, there were both housekeeping TFs, which were universally found in all cell types, and specific TFs, which were highly enriched in known factors that determine the fate of the analyzed tissue or cell type. The importance of a small subset of TFs for determining the overall accessible chromatin landscape of a cell suggests that gene regulatory logic may be simpler than what has previously been appreciated."},

Although non-pelleting strains have increased growth rates, their morphology also leads to a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the culture broth, which negatively impacts the process dynamics. Here, we applied immobilization of Streptomyces lividans 66 using alginate as semi-solid matrix. This alginate-mediated micro-encapsulation increased the production of the extracellular enzyme tyrosinase more than three-fold. The increased production was accompanied by extended viability of the mycelium and a dramatic reduction in the release of intracellular proteins into the culture broth. Our data demonstrate the utility of microencapsulation as a powerful technique to achieve higher yields and lower downstream-processing costs of streptomycetes."},

Directional effects of such annotations on disease risk enable stronger statements about causal mechanisms of disease than enrichments of corresponding unsigned annotations. Here we introduce a new method, signed LD profile regression, for detecting such directional effects using GWAS summary statistics, and we apply the method using 382 signed annotations reflecting predicted TF binding. We show via theory and simulations that our method is well-powered and is well-calibrated even when TF binding sites co-localize with other enriched regulatory elements, which can confound unsigned enrichment methods.

In zebrafish, DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns are programmed in transcriptionally-quiescent cleavage embryos; remarkably, paternally-inherited patterns are maintained, whereas maternal patterns are reprogrammed to match the paternal. Here we provide the mechanism, by demonstrating that 'Placeholder' nucleosomes, containing histone H2A variant H2A.Z(FV) and H3K4me1, occupy virtually all regions lacking DNAme in both sperm and cleavage embryos, and resides at promoters encoding housekeeping and early embryonic transcription factors. Upon genome-wide transcriptional onset, genes with Placeholder become either active (H3K4me3) or silent (H3K4me3/K27me3). Importantly, functional perturbation causing Placeholder loss confers DNAme accumulation, whereas acquisition/expansion of Placeholder confers DNA hypomethylation and improper gene activation. Thus, during transcriptionally-quiescent gametic and embryonic stages, an H2A.Z(FV)/H3K4me1-containing Placeholder nucleosome deters DNAme, poising parental genes for either gene-specific activation or facultative repression."},

In the present work, photosynthetic and biochemical traits were investigated in four rice genotypes under two NaCl (0 and 150 mM) concentration to assess the stomatal, mesophyll and biochemical contributions to reduced photosynthetic rate (A) in salt stressed leaves. Our results indicated that salinity led to a decrease in A, leaf osmotic potential, electron transport rate and CO2 concentrations in the chloroplasts (Cc) of rice leaves. Decreased A in salt-stressed leaves was mainly attributable to low Cc, which was determined by stomatal and mesophyll conductance. The increased stomatal limitation was mainly related to the low leaf osmotic potential caused by soil salinity. However, the increased mesophyll limitation in salt stressed leaves was related to both osmotic stress and ion stress. These findings highlight the importance of considering mesophyll conductance when developing salinity-tolerant rice cultivars."},

The p-value estimator conventionally used in existing genome-wide association study (GWAS) regressions assumes a normally-distributed dependent variable, or relies on a central limit theorem based approximation. The central limit theorem approximation is unreliable for GWAS regression p-values, and measured phenotypes often have markedly non-normal distributions. A normal mixture distribution better fits observed phenotypic variables, and we provide exact small-sample p-values for the standard GWAS regressions under this flexible distributional assumption. We illustrate the adjustment using a years-of-education phenotypic variable."},

However the sociobiology underlying this antimicrobial tolerance remains largely unexplored. Here we analyze how inter-species interactions can increase antimicrobial tolerance. We apply our approach to 17 industrially-relevant multispecies biofilm models, based on species isolated from 58 contaminating biofilms in three breweries. Sulfathiazole is used as antimicrobial agent because it shows the highest activity out of 22 biofilm inhibitors tested. Our analysis reveals that competitive interactions dominate among species within brewery biofilms. We show that antimicrobial treatment can reduce the level of competition and therefore cause a subset of species to bloom. The result is a lower percentage inhibition of these species and increased tolerance. In addition, we show that the presence of competing species can also directly enhance the inherent tolerance of microbes to antimicrobial treatment, either because species protect each other or because they induce specific tolerance phenotypes as a response to competitors (i.e. competition sensing). Overall, our study emphasizes that the dominance of competitive interactions is central to the enhanced antimicrobial tolerance of the multispecies biofilms and that the activity of antimicrobials against multispecies biofilms cannot be predicted based on their effect against mono-cultures."},

Here we report the effect of ethylene on secondary cell wall formation and the molecular connection between ethylene signaling and wood formation.  Methods: We applied exogenous ethylene or its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to wild type and ethylene insensitive hybrid aspen trees (Populus tremula x tremuloides) and studied secondary cell wall anatomy, chemistry and ultrastructure. We furthermore analyzed the transcriptome (RNA Seq) after ACC application to wild type and ethylene insensitive trees.  Key results: We demonstrate that ACC and ethylene induce gelatinous-layers (G-layers) and alter the fiber cell wall cellulose microfibril angle. G-layers are tertiary wall layers rich in cellulose, typically found in tension wood of aspen trees. A vast majority of transcripts affected by ACC are downstream of ethylene perception and include a large number of transcription factors (TFs). Motif-analyses reveal potential connections between ethylene TFs (ERFs, EIN3/EIL1) and wood formation.

Previous work has characterized temporal accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However, real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics of the environment, experimenters could control the rats accumulation timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind."},

However, primary neutrophils are remarkably short-lived, limiting their experimental usefulness in the laboratory. Thus, human myeloid cell lines have been established and characterized for their ability to undergo neutrophil-like differentiation in vitro. The HL-60 cell line and its PLB-985 sub-line are commonly used as a model for human neutrophil behavior, but how closely gene expression in differentiated cells resembles that of primary neutrophils has remained unclear.  Results: In the present study, we compared the effectiveness of differentiation protocols and used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare the transcriptomes of HL-60 and PLB-985 cells with published data for human and mouse primary neutrophils. Among commonly used differentiation protocols for neutrophil-like cell lines, addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gave the best combination of cell viability and expression of markers for differentiation. However, combining DMSO with the serum-free-supplement Nutridoma resulted in an increased chemotactic response and cell surface expression of the neutrophil markers FPR1 and CD11b without a cost in viability. RNA-seq analysis of HL-60 and PLB-985 cells before and after differentiation showed that differentiation broadly increases the similarity in gene expression between the cell lines and primary neutrophils. Furthermore, the gene expression pattern of the differentiated cell lines correlated slightly better with that of human neutrophils than the mouse neutrophil pattern did. Finally, we created a publicly available gene expression database that is searchable by gene name and by protein domain content, where users can compare gene expression in HL-60, PLB-985 and primary human and mouse neutrophils.  Conclusions: Our study verifies that a DMSO-based differentiation protocol for HL-60 and PLB-985 cell lines gives superior differentiation and cell viability relative to other common protocols, and indicates that addition of Nutridoma may be preferable for studies of chemotaxis. Our neutrophil gene expression database will be a valuable tool to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between the cell lines and primary neutrophils, to compare expression levels for genes of interest, and to improve the design of tools for genetic perturbations."},

A cis-acting positive feedback, which in mice is mediated by mutual repression of Xist and its antisense transcript Tsix, together with a trans-acting negative feedback are sufficient to explain mono-allelic Xist up-regulation. The model can reproduce data from several mutant, aneuploid and polyploid murine cell lines and explains Xist expression patterns in other mammalian species.

We then utilize the best-performing variant to build a three-color patterning system responsive to two different homoserine lactones. We validate the AND gate-like behavior of this system both in cell suspension and in surface culture.

Zebrafish has recently gained wide attention as a behavioral model with which to study the neurobehavioral effects of acute and chronic alcohol use, including withdrawal. The literature, however, is very contradictory on findings regarding withdrawal effects, with some studies reporting increased anxiety, while others report no effect. A meta-analytic approach was taken to find the sources of this heterogeneity, and ethanol concentration during exposure and exposure duration were found to be the main sources of variation. A conceptual replication was also made using continuous exposure for 16 days in waterborne ethanol (0.5%) and assessing anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark test after 60 min withdrawal. Withdrawal was shown to decrease preference for darkness, consistent with decreased anxiety, but to increase risk assessment, consistent with increased anxiety. Animals were also subjected to the withdrawal protocol and injected with pilocarpine in a sub-convulsive dose to assess susceptibility to seizures. The protocol was sufficient to increase susceptibility to seizures in animals exposed to ethanol. Finally, withdrawal also decreased catalase activity in the brain, but not in the head kidney, suggesting that oxidative stress could be a mechanism associated with the behavioral effects of ethanol withdrawal."},

Different cytometry studies often involve diverse sets of markers. Moreover, the detected values of the same marker are inconsistent between studies due to different experimental designs and cytometer configurations. As a result, the cell subsets identified by existing auto-gating methods cannot be directly compared across studies. We developed MetaCyto for automated meta-analysis of both flow and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. By combining clustering methods with a silhouette scanning method, MetaCyto is able to identify commonly labeled cell subsets across studies, thus enabling meta-analysis. Applying MetaCyto across a set of 10 heterogeneous cytometry studies totaling 2926 samples enabled us to identify multiple cell populations exhibiting differences in abundance between White and Asian adults.

Despite improvements in the CRISPR-editing molecular toolbox in cell lines and primary cells, identifying and purifying properly edited clones remains slow, laborious and low-yield. Here, we establish a new method that uses cell manipulation on a chip with Opto-Electronic Positioning (OEP) technology to enable clonal isolation and selection of edited cells. We focused on editing CXCR4 in primary human T cells, a gene that encodes a co-receptor for HIV entry. T cells hold significant potential for cell-based therapy, but the gene-editing efficiency and expansion potential of these cells is limited. We describe here a method to obviate these limitations. Briefly, after electroporation of cells with CXCR4-targeting Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), single T cells were isolated on a chip, where they proliferated over time into well-resolved colonies. Phenotypic consequences of genome editing could be rapidly assessed on-chip with cell-surface staining for CXCR4. Furthermore, independent of phenotype, individual colonies could be identified based on their specific genotype at the 5-10 cell stage. Each colony was split and sequentially exported for immediate on-target sequencing and validation, and further off-chip clonal expansion of the validated clones. We were able to assess single-clone editing efficiencies, including the rate of monoallelic and biallelic indels or precise nucleotide replacements. This new method will enable identification and selection of perfectly edited clones within 10 days from Cas9-RNP introduction in cells based on the phenotype and/or genotype"},

We cultured murine ES-CMs in a collagen gel (3D) at a low density, or on collagen-coated polystyrene (2D) and found that 3D culture results in dramatic improvement of the maturation rate and end-state gene expression of ES-CMs. There are two main differences between CMs cultured in 3D versus 2D; in 3D the mechanical stiffness of the environment is lower, enabling auxotonic instead of isometric contraction; and, in 3D the amount of cell-cell interaction is higher. To isolate the contributions, we first cultured ES-CMs on gels (2D substrates) that are softer than tissue culture plastic, enabling auxotonic contraction, while controlling for dimensionality and cell interaction. This indeed promoted a mature gene expression profile, while also enabling the maintenance of sarcomeres. Next, we determined that increased cell-cell interaction inhibits the mature gene expression of ES-CMs. Thus, auxotonic contraction is the likely mechanism for improved gene expression in sub-confluent 3D culture. However, 2D auxotonic contraction may offer a suitable compromise between obtaining enhanced gene expression and morphology. After 6 weeks of culture on gels, via Di-8-ANEPPs and WGA staining we also detected CMs forming a t-tubule network. Collectively these results demonstrate that 3D and 2D cultures that enable auxotonic contraction enhance aspects of the maturation of ES-CMs."},

Two mechanisms control their lifetimes: the ILF (IntraLumenal Fragment) and vReD (Vacuole REcycling and Degradation) pathways. But it is not clear if they function independently. Using S. cerevisiae as a model, here we show that the ILF pathway mediates constitutive turnover of the lysine transporter Ypq1 and zinc transporter Cot1-known vReD client proteins-in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, the vReD pathway mediates constitutive degradation of the amino acid transporter Vba4. Activation of TOR with cycloheximide enhances their degradation by these pathways. However, misfolding by heat stress shunts all three into the ILF pathway. Thus, both pathways control individual transporter lifetimes, although only the ILF pathway mediates protein quality control. The pathway chosen depends on protein fate: degradation is imminent by the ILF pathway, whereas the vReD pathway permits reuse."},

The cellular response to an external mechanical stimulation has been investigated with various static and dynamic systems, so far limited to global deformations or to local stimulation through discrete substrates. To apply local and dynamic mechanical constraints at the single cell scale through a continuous surface, we have developed and modelled magneto-active substrates made of magnetic micro-pillars embedded in an elastomer. Constrained and unconstrained substrates are analysed to map surface stress resulting from the magnetic actuation of the micro-pillars and the adherent cells. These substrates have a rigidity in the range of cell matrices, and the magnetic micro-pillars generate local forces in the range of cellular forces, both in traction and compression. As an application, we followed the protrusive activity of cells subjected to dynamic stimulations. Our magneto-active substrates thus represent a new tool to study mechanotransduction in single cells, and complement existing techniques by exerting a local and dynamic stimulation, traction and compression, through a continuous soft substrate."},

To elucidate this transition, we study a theoretical model of information-storing heteropolymers capable of template-assisted ligation and subjected to cyclic non-equilibrium driving forces. We discover that this simple physical system undergoes a spontaneous reduction of the information entropy due to the competition of chains for constituent monomers. This natural-selection-like process ultimately results in the survival  of a limited subset of polymer sequences. Importantly, the number of surviving sequences remains exponentially large, thus opening up the possibility of further increase in complexity due to  Darwinian evolution. We also propose potential experimental implementations of our model using either biopolymers or artificial nano-structures."},

Here, we use interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy to investigate a minimal acto-myosin network linked to a supported lipid bilayer. We demonstrate that we are able to detect and distinguish actin and myosin filaments label-free based on their interferometric scattering contrast. The scattering-based approach allows us to follow diffusion of single actin filaments attached to the bilayer at high frame rates revealing different types of diffusion depending on filament length. We investigate the directed motion of myosin II filaments on the actin network quantifying binding kinetics and processivity at varying ATP concentrations. Finally, we follow long-term network flow and organization enabling us to compare our observations with theoretical models of network dynamics. Our results demonstrate that iSCAT microscopy is an ideal tool to investigate multi-component systems on a broad range of length scales, resolving molecular scale mechanisms such as single myosin filament dynamics as well as acto-myosin network contraction on the mesoscopic scale."},

This classical issue is discussed in the light of recent neurophysiological data which, thanks to direct measurements of temporal and spatial brain activation, provide new avenues to investigate the biological substrate of human language. After describing principal techniques and methods, I critically discuss magnetoencephalographic and electroencephalographic findings of speech processing based on event-related potentials and event-related oscillatory rhythms. The available data do not permit us to clearly disambiguate between neural evidence suggesting pure acoustic patterns and those indicating abstract phonological features. Starting from this evidence, which only at the surface represents a limit, I develop a preliminary proposal where discretization and phonological abstraction are the result of a continuous process that converts spectro-temporal (acoustic) states into neurophysiological states such that some properties of the former undergo changes interacting with the latter until a new equilibrium is reached. I assume that, at the end of the process, phonological segments (and the related categorical processes) take the form of continuous neural states represented by nested cortical oscillatory rhythms spatially distributed in the auditory cortex. Within this perspective, distinctive features (i.e., the relevant representational linguistic primitives) are represented by both spatially local and distributed neural selectivity. I suggest that this hypothesis is suitable to explain hierarchical layout of auditory cortex highly specialized in analyzing different aspects of the speech signal and to explain learning and memory processes during the acquisition of phonological systems."},

During productions of \"head\", \"bed\", and \"dead\", the first formant of the vowel sound was altered in real-time towards the first formant of the vowel sound in \"had\", \"bad\", and \"dad\". Compensatory changes in first and second formant production were used as a measure of motor adaptation. TDCS to either the motor cortex or the cerebellum improved sensorimotor learning in speech compared to sham stimulation. However, in the case of cerebellar tDCS, production changes were restricted to the source of the acoustical error (i.e. the first formant). Motor cortex tDCS drove production changes that offset errors in the first formant, but, unlike cerebellar tDCS, adaptive changes in the second formant also occurred. The results suggest that motor cortex and cerebellar tDCS have both shared and dissociable effects on motor adaptation. The study provides initial causal evidence in speech production that the motor cortex and the cerebellum support different aspects of sensorimotor learning. We propose that motor cortex tDCS drives sensorimotor learning towards previously learned patterns of movement, while cerebellar tDCS focuses sensorimotor learning on error correction."},

Collins"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/202507 ", "abstract": "Neuron activity accompanies synapse formation and maintenance, but how early circuit activity contributes to behavior development is not well understood. Here, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying motor circuit as a model to understand how coordinated cell and circuit activity develops and drives a robust two-state behavior in adults. Using calcium imaging in behaving animals, we find the Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) and vulval muscles show rhythmic calcium transients in L4 larvae before eggs are produced. HSN activity in L4 is tonic and lacks the alternating burst-firing/quiescent pattern seen in egg-laying adults. Vulval muscle activity in L4 is initially uncoordinated, but becomes synchronous as the anterior and posterior muscle arms meet at HSN synaptic release sites. However, coordinated muscle activity does not require presynaptic HSN input. Using reversible silencing experiments, we show that neuronal and vulval muscle activity in L4 is not required for the onset of adult behavior. Instead, the accumulation of eggs in the adult uterus renders the muscles sensitive to HSN input. Sterilization or acute electrical silencing of the vulval muscles inhibits presynaptic HSN activity, and reversal of muscle silencing triggers a homeostatic increase in HSN activity and egg release that maintains ~12-15 eggs in the uterus. Feedback of egg accumulation depends upon the vulval muscle postsynaptic terminus, suggesting a retrograde signal sustains HSN synaptic activity and egg release. Thus, circuit development and activity is necessary but not sufficient to drive behavior without additional modulation by sensory feedback."},

The San Clemente Island night lizard, Xantusia riversiana reticulata, is endemic to two California Channel Islands, each with a history of anthropogenic disturbance. We genotyped 917 individuals from San Clemente Island and Santa Barbara Island at 23 microsatellite loci to quantify population structure and identify natural and anthropogenic landscape features affecting intra-island connectivity. We found significant, but shallow, population structure on each island with sites < 400 m apart identified as distinct genepools. Landscape genetic analyses identified conductive habitat as California boxthorn and prickly pear cactus on both islands. Landscape features which decreased connectivity were unique to each island and included natural and human-mediated features. These results can inform management plans on each island by identifying habitat targets for mitigation and restoration efforts designed to improve connectivity. Our results highlight the need for considering fine-scale features correlated with contemporary and historical patterns of fragmentation, especially in small and isolated habitats on the mainland that may be analogous to oceanic islands."},

In the distraction condition, the brain activity evoked by masked digits was drastically reduced in both groups, but early bottom-up visual activation could still be detected and did not differ between patients and controls. By contrast, under focused top-down attention, a major impairment was observed: in patients, contrary to controls, the N1 component was insufficiently amplified by attention, and the late non-linear ignition associated with the P3 component was drastically reduced. Interestingly, the patients showed an essentially normal attentional amplification of the P1 and N2 components.

Deem"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/204388 ", "abstract": "Background: Clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), despite being rare, may account for more than 95% of metastases. Cells in these clusters do not undergo a complete epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) but retain some epithelial traits as compared to individually disseminating tumor cells. Determinants of single cell dissemination versus collective dissemination remain elusive. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype that chiefly metastasizes via CTC clusters, is a promising model for studying mechanisms of collective tumor cell dissemination. Previous studies on breast cancer and adult acute myeloid leukemia, motivated by a theory that suggests physical systems with hierarchical organization tend to be more adaptable, have found that the expression of metastasis associated genes is more hierarchically organized in cases of successful metastases.  Methods: We used the cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) to quantify the hierarchical organization in the expression networks of two distinct gene sets, collective dissemination associated genes and IBC associated genes, in cancer cell lines and in tumor samples from breast cancer patients. Hypothesizing that a higher CCC for collective dissemination associated genes and for IBC associated genes would be associated with a more evident epithelial phenotype and with worse outcomes in breast cancer patients, we evaluated the correlation of CCC with different phenotypic groups.  Results: The CCC of both gene networks, the collective dissemination associated gene network and the IBC associated gene network, was higher in (a) epithelial cell lines as compared to mesenchymal cell lines and (b) tumor samples from IBC patients, as compared to samples from non-IBC breast cancer patients. A higher CCC of both networks was also correlated with a higher rate of metastatic relapse in breast cancer patients. Neither the levels of CDH1 gene expression, nor gene set enrichment analysis could provide similar insights.  Conclusions: These results suggest that retention of some epithelial traits in disseminating tumor cells as IBC progresses promotes successful breast cancer metastasis to distant organs. The CCC provides additional information regarding the organizational complexity of gene expression in comparison to differential gene expression analyses. We have shown that the CCC may be a useful metric for investigating the collective dissemination phenotype and a prognostic factor for IBC."},

This dynamics may differ depending on the scale investigated (annual or pluriannual), particularly for annual crop pathogens with both sexual and asexual reproduction cycles. We assessed this time-scale effect, by comparing aggressiveness changes in a local Zymoseptoria tritici population over an eight-month cropping season and a six-year period of wheat monoculture. We collected two pairs of subpopulations to represent the annual and pluriannual scales: from leaf lesions at the beginning and end of a single annual epidemic, and from crop debris at the beginning and end of a six-year period. We assessed two aggressiveness traits - latent period and lesion size - on sympatric and allopatric host varieties. A trend toward decreased latent period concomitant with a significant loss of variability was established during the course of the annual epidemic, but not over the six-year period. Furthermore, a significant cultivar effect (sympatric vs. allopatric) on the average aggressiveness of the isolates revealed host adaptation, arguing that the observed patterns could result from selection. We thus provide an experimental body of evidence of an epidemiological trade-off between the intra- and inter-annual scales in the evolution of aggressiveness in a local plant pathogen population. More aggressive isolates were collected from upper leaves, on which disease severity is usually lower than on the lower part of the plants left in the field as crop debris after harvest. We suggest that these isolates play little role in sexual reproduction, due to an Allee effect (difficulty finding mates at low pathogen densities), particularly as the upper parts of the plant are removed from the field, explaining the lack of transmission of increases in aggressiveness between epidemics."},

How does the framework of degeneracy assimilate into an encoding system where the ability to change is an essential ingredient for storing new incoming information? Could degeneracy maintain the balance between the apparently contradictory goals of the need to change for encoding and the need to resist change towards maintaining homeostasis? In this review, we explore these fundamental questions with the mammalian hippocampus as an example encoding system. We systematically catalog lines of evidence, spanning multiple scales of analysis, that demonstrate the expression of degeneracy in hippocampal physiology and plasticity. We assess the potential of degeneracy as a framework to achieve encoding and homeostasis without cross-interferences, and postulate that multiscale parametric and interactional complexity could establish disparate routes towards accomplishing these conjoint goals. These disparate routes then provide several degrees of freedom to the encoding-homeostasis system in accomplishing its tasks in an input- and state-dependent manner. Finally, the expression of degeneracy spanning multiple scales offers an ideal reconciliation to several outstanding controversies, through the recognition that the seemingly contradictory disparate observations are merely alternate routes that the system might recruit towards accomplishment of its goals. Juxtaposed against the ubiquitous prevalence of degeneracy and its strong links to evolution, it is perhaps apt to add a corollary to Theodosius Dobzhansky's famous quote and state \"nothing in physiology makes sense except in the light of degeneracy\"."},

This is typically needed when genotype imputation is not feasible. Oftentimes, cohorts of such a meta-analysis are variable in terms of ancestry and available sample size varies SNP-to-SNP. Both phenomena violate the assumption of current methods that an external LD matrix and the covariance of the Z-statistics are the same. \nResults: To address these two issues, we present two extensions to existing summary statistics imputation method. Both extensions manipulate the LD matrix needed for summary statistics imputation. Based on simulations using real data we find that accounting for ancestry admixture only becomes relevant with sample size > 1000, while for smaller reference panels the total sample size (irrespective of ancestry) seems more relevant. Furthermore, incorporating varying sample size across SNPs reduces MSE by 2.6-fold compared to the conventional approach."},

Yet, replication-mediated genomic instability is integral to oncogenesis, and p53 mutations promote tumor progression and drug-resistance. By delineating human and murine separation-of-function p53 alleles, we find that p53 null and gain-of-function (GOF) mutations exhibit defects in restart of stalled or damaged DNA replication forks driving genomic instability independent of transcription activation. By assaying protein-DNA fork interactions in single cells, we unveil a p53-MLL3-enabled recruitment of MRE11 DNA replication restart nuclease. Importantly, p53 defects or depletion unexpectedly allow mutagenic RAD52 and POL\u03b8 pathways to hijack stalled forks, which we find reflected in p53 defective breast-cancer patient COSMIC mutational signatures. These data uncover p53 as a keystone regulator of replication homeostasis within a DNA restart network. Mechanistically, this has important implications for development of resistance in cancer therapy. Combined, these results define an unexpected role for p53 suppression of replication genome instability."},

Previous neuroimaging studies have yielded mixed results of its brain network deficits. We proposed a novel hypothesis that parietal memory network, centered at the precuneus, plays a critical role in auditory hallucination. This network is adjacent and partially overlaps with the default mode network, and has been associated with brain function of familiarity labelling in memory processing. Using a longitudinal design and a large cohort of first-episode, drug-naive schizophrenia patients, we examined this hypothesis and further investigated whether the functional connectivity patterns of the parietal memory network can serve as a neuroimaging marker for auditory hallucination and help to predict future treatment effects. Resting-state scans from 59 first-episode drug-naive schizophrenic patients (27 with and 32 without hallucination) and 53 healthy control subjects were acquired at the baseline test, and 56 of them were scanned again after two months. Functional connectivity strength within the parietal memory network and between this network and memory hubs was across the three groups at baseline and follow-up scans. Results showed that decreased functional connectivity strength within the parietal memory network was specific to the auditory hallucination group (p = 0.009, compare to the healthy subjects; p = 0.029, compare to the patients without hallucination), with the precuneus representing the largest group difference. The intra-network connectivity strength of the precuneus negatively correlated with the severity of hallucination at the baseline scan (r = -0.437, p = 0.029), and it was significantly increased after two-month medication (p = 0.039). Logistic regression analysis and cross-validation test demonstrated that the functional connectivity strength of the precuneus and precuneus-hippocampus connectivity could differentiate patients with or without auditory hallucination with a sensitivity of 0.750 and a specificity of 0.708. Moreover, cross-validation test showed that these imaging features at the baseline scan well predicted the extents of positive symptom improvement in the hallucination group after the two-month medication (R2 = 0.433, p = 0.022). Our results provide evidence for a critical role of the parietal memory network underlying auditory hallucination, and further propose a novel neuroimaging marker for identifying patients, accessing severity, and prognosis of treatment effect for auditory hallucination."},

Theoretical analyses of idealized feedforward networks suggest that several conditions have to be satisfied in order for activity to propagate faithfully across layers.  Verifying these concepts experimentally in networks has not been possible owing to the vast number of variables that must be controlled.  Here, we culture cortical neurons in a chamber with sequentially connected compartments, optogenetically stimulate individual neurons in the first layer with high spatiotemporal resolution, and monitor the subthreshold and suprathreshold potentials in subsequent layers.  In the first layer, a brief stimulus with different temporal precisions resulted in the modulation of the firing rate.  This temporal to rate transformation was propagated to other layers as a sustained response, thereby preserving rate information.  This novel mode of propagation occurred in the balanced excitatory-inhibitory regime and is mediated by NMDA-mediated synapses activated by recurrent activity."},

We validate these analyses by predicting nuclei in basal-ganglia circuits as top-ranked targets for 43 local patients with Parkinson's disease and 90 patients from public database. However, individual connectome-based predictions demonstrate that globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus (STN) constituted as the best choice for 21.1% and 19.5% of patients, respectively. Notably, the priority rank of STN significantly correlated with motor symptom severity in the local cohort. By introducing whole-brain network diffusion dynamics, these findings unfold a new dimension of brain connectomics and underscore the importance of neural network modeling for personalized DBS therapy, which warrants experimental investigation to validate its clinical utility."},

An efficient motor in cargo transport would travel with a high speed and a minimal error in transport time (or distance) while consuming minimal amount of energy. The travel distance and its variance of motor are, however, physically constrained by energy consumption, the principle of which has recently been formulated into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Here, we reinterpret the uncertainty measure (Q) defined in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation such that a motor efficient in cargo transport is characterized with a small Q. Analyses on the motility data from several types of molecular motors show that Q is a nonmonotic function of ATP concentration and load (f). For kinesin-1, Q is locally minimized at [ATP] \u2248 200 \u03bcM and f \u2248 4 pN. Remarkably, for the mutant with a longer neck-linker this local minimum vanishes, and the energetic cost to achieve the same precision as the wild-type increases significantly, which underscores the importance of molecular structure in transport properties. For the biological motors studied here, their value of Q is semi-optimized under the cellular condition ([ATP] \u2248 1 mM, f = 0 \u2212 1 pN). We find that among the motors, kinesin-1 at single molecule level is the most efficient in cargo transport."},

We chronically implanted a polyimide microelectrode in the dorsolateral striatum of rats. First, we analyzed the c-fos immunoreactivity following high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the dorsolateral striatum and second, using GFAP and ED1 immunocytochemistry, the brain tissue response. Acute as well as chronic HFS showed no significant change of neuronal c-fos expression in the dorsolateral striatum and corresponding cortical areas. We found that the sole chronic implantation of a polyimide microelectrode leads to a reaction of the surrounding neurons, i.e. c-fos expression, along the implantation trajectory. We also observed the formation of a glial scar around the microelectrode with a low number of inflammation cells. Histological and statistical analysis of NeuN positive cells showed no 'kill zone', which accompanied neuronal cell death around the implantation site."},

Homeostasis is achieved by a set of complex mechanisms that involve regulatory feedback loops. Similarly, tumors are believed to be maintained by a minority population of cancer stem cells, while the bulk of the tumor is made up of more differentiated cells, and there is indication that some of the feedback loops that operate in tissues continue to be functional in tumors. Mathematical models of such tissue hierarchies, including feedback loops, have been analyzed in a variety of different contexts. Apart from stem cells giving rise to differentiated cells, it has also been observed that more differentiated cells can de-differentiate into stem cells, both in healthy tissue and tumors, aspects of which have also been investigated mathematically. This paper analyses the effect of de-differentiation on the basic and evolutionary dynamics of cells in the context of tissue hierarchy models that include negative feedback regulation of the cell populations. The models predict that in the presence of de-differentiation, the fixation probability of a neutral mutant is lower than in its absence. Therefore, if de-differentiation occurs, a mutant with identical parameters compared to the wild-type cell population behaves like a disadvantageous mutant. Similarly, the process of de-differentiation is found to lower the fixation probability of an advantageous mutant. These results indicate that the presence of de-differentiation can lower the rates of tumor initiation and progression in the context of the models considered here."},

Here, we model the processing of mixtures by mammalian ORNs, focusing on the role of inhibitory mechanisms. Theoretically predicted response curves capture experimentally determined glomerular responses imaged by a calcium indicator expressed in ORNs of live, breathing mice. Antagonism leads to an effective \"normalization\" of the ensemble glomerular response, which arises from a novel mechanism involving the distinct statistical properties of receptor binding and activation, without any recurrent neuronal circuitry. Normalization allows our encoding model to outperform non-interacting models in odor discrimination tasks, and to explain several psychophysical experiments in humans."},

However, most target enrichment methods require amplification. Some genomic regions, such as those with extreme GC content and repetitive sequences, are recalcitrant to faithful amplification.

We have developed a novel, amplification-free enrichment technique that employs the CRISPR-Cas9 system for specific targeting multiple genomic loci. This method, in conjunction with long reads generated through Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing and unbiased coverage, enables enrichment and sequencing of complex genomic regions that cannot be investigated with other technologies. Using human genomic DNA samples, we demonstrate successful targeting of causative loci for Huntington's disease (HTT; CAG repeat), Fragile X syndrome (FMR1; CGG repeat), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (C9orf72; GGGGCC repeat), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) (ATXN10; variable ATTCT repeat). The method, amenable to multiplexing across multiple genomic loci, uses an amplification-free approach that facilitates the isolation of hundreds of individual on-target molecules in a single SMRT Cell and accurate sequencing through long repeat stretches, regardless of extreme GC percent or sequence complexity content. Our novel targeted sequencing method opens new doors to genomic analyses independent of PCR amplification that will facilitate the study of repeat expansion disorders."},

An under-studied approach for modeling these adaptive processes comes from the engineering field of control theory, which provides general principles for regulating dynamical systems, often without requiring a generative model. The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is one of the most popular models of industrial process control. The proportional term is analogous to the \"delta rule\" in psychology, adjusting estimates in proportion to each successive error in prediction. The integral and derivative terms augment this update to simultaneously improve accuracy and stability. Here, we tested whether the PID algorithm can describe how people sequentially adjust their predictions in response to new information. Across three experiments, we found that the PID controller was an effective model of participants' decisions in noisy, changing environments. In Experiment 1, we re-analyzed a change-point detection experiment, and showed that participants' behavior incorporated elements of PID updating. Experiments 2-3 employed a gradual change-point task that was optimized to detect PID-like adjustments. In both experiments, the PID model offered better descriptions of behavioral adjustments than the classical delta-rule model. We further examined how participants weighted different PID terms in response to salient environmental events. Across experiments, we found that the weights on these control terms were modulated by reward, surprise, and outcome entropy. These experiments provide preliminary evidence that adaptive behavior in dynamic environments resembles PID control."},

We develop a network model to describe dynamics of the system treating the receptor complex with CheW and P3P4P5 domains of CheA as a regulated enzyme with two substrates, P1 and ATP. The model enables us to search the hypothesis space systematically for the simplest possible regulation mechanism consistent with the available data. Our analysis reveals a novel dual regulation mechanism wherein besides regulating ATP binding the receptor activity has to regulate one other key reaction, either P1 binding or phosphotransfer between P1 and ATP. Furthermore, our study shows that the receptors only control kinetic rates of the enzyme without changing its equilibrium properties. Predictions are made for future experiments to distinguish the remaining two dual-regulation mechanisms. The systems-biology approach of combining modeling and a large input-output data-set should be applicable for studying other complex biological processes."},

In this work, we have characterized neuronal activity and behavioral performance as a function of the outcome of the previous trial. We found that the outcome of the immediately previous trial (n-1) significantly changes, in the current trial (n), the activity of single cells and behavioral performance. The outcome of trial n-2, however, does not affect either behavior or neuronal activity. Moreover, the outcome of difficult trials had a greater impact on performance and recruited more PMv neurons than the outcome of easy trials.

In total, 1,526 exons and exon sets from 1,236 genes showed significant splicing differences among primates. More than 60% of these differences represent constitutive-to-alternative exon transitions while an additional 25% represent changes in exon inclusion frequency. These two dominant evolutionary patterns have contrasting conservation, regulation, and functional features. The sum of these features indicates that, despite their prevalence, constitutive-to-alternative exon transitions do not substantially contribute to long-term functional transcriptome changes. Conversely, changes in exon inclusion frequency appear to be functionally relevant, especially for changes taking place in the brain on the human evolutionary lineage."},

In the central Red Sea, a naturally high alkalinity is beneficial to reef growth, but rising water temperatures impair the calcification capacity of reef-building organisms. However, it is currently unknown how beneficial and detrimental factors affect the balance between calcification and erosion, and thereby the overall growth of the reef framework. To provide insight into present-day carbonate budgets and reef growth dynamics in the central Red Sea, we measured in situ net-accretion and net-erosion rates (Gnet) by deployment of limestone blocks and estimated census-based carbonate budgets (Gbudget) in four reef sites along a cross-shelf gradient (25 km). We assessed abiotic variables (i.e., temperature, inorganic nutrients, and carbonate system variables) and biotic drivers (i.e., calcifier and bioeroder abundances). On average, total alkalinity AT (2346-2431 \u03bcmol kg-1), aragonite saturation state (4.5-5.2 \u03a9a), and pCO2 (283-315 \u03bcatm) were close to estimates of pre-industrial global ocean surface waters. Despite these calcification-favorable carbonate system conditions, Gnet and Gbudget encompassed positive (offshore) and negative net-production (midshore-lagoon and exposed nearshore site) estimates. Notably, Gbudget maxima were lower compared to reef growth from pristine Indian Ocean sites. Yet, a comparison with historical data from the northern Red Sea suggests that overall reef growth in the Red Sea has likely remained similar since 1995. When assessing sites across the shelf gradient, AT correlated well with reef growth rates (\u03c1 = 0.89), while temperature was a weaker, negative correlate (\u03c1 = -0.71). Further, AT explained about 65% of Gbudget in a best fitting distance-based linear model. Interestingly, parrotfish abundances added up to 82% of explained variation, further substantiating recent studies highlighting the importance of parrotfish to reef ecosystem function. Our study provides a baseline that will be particularly useful in assessing future trajectories of reef growth capacities in the Red Sea under continuous ocean warming and acidification."},

To definitively examine the role of these two channels in transduction, we showed that deletion of either or both of their genes selectively in hair cells had no effect on auditory function. We suggest that TRPV5, TRPV6, TRPM6, and TRPM7 are unlikely to be the pore-forming subunit of the hair-cell transduction channel."},

Marcus", "Maxim Bazhenov"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/176446 ", "abstract": "Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem."},

In Neurospora crassa, the BTA1 gene encodes the betaine lipid synthase, which is necessary and sufficient for DGTS synthesis. BTA1 expression and DGTS accumulation are part of the fungal phosphorus (Pi) deprivation (PHO) regulon, mediated by the NUC-1/Pho4p transcription factor. We now demonstrate that the human pathogen Candida albicans encodes a BTA1 ortholog (CaBTA1), which is activated during Pi scarcity. The CaBTA1 gene is also induced under certain biofilm-promoting conditions independent of Pi starvation. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR showed a significant increase in CaBTA1 expression in response to Pi limitation. Thin-layer chromatography and LC-ESI-MS/MS confirmed the replacement of PC with DGTS in wild-type under low Pi and showed the absence of DGTS in the bta1\u2206\u2206 mutant. Pi limitation in the gut of critically ill patients also triggers the switching of C. albicans into an invasive filamentous form. To assess the role of BTA1 and DGTS in the pathogenicity of C. albicans in vitro, we compared the growth and morphology of bta1\u2206\u2206 and wild type in hyphae-inducing media and observed defects in biofilm formation and invasive growth in the bta1\u2206\u2206 mutant. This observation is complemented by RNA-seq data demonstrating that Pi starvation in planktonic C. albicans cells induces the expression of virulence-associated cell surface proteins. Taken together, these results show novel functional interactions between lipid metabolism and remodeling, biofilm formation, and the phosphate starvation response of C. albicans."},

It has become evident, however, that structural differences such as the long N- and C-termini of the eukaryotic neurotransmitter transporters are likely to impart phenotypic properties not shared by the bacterial homologs. These structural \"additions\" to the common molecular architecture have been shown to be involved in functions, including reverse transport (efflux), regulated by phosphorylation and by interactions with lipids found only in the eukaryotic cell membranes. To learn how the phenotypes of the eukaryotic transporters are enabled by molecular mechanisms involving these structural additions we have used large- scale molecular dynamics simulations of the wild type and mutant constructs of the human dopamine transporter (hDAT), and comparative Markov State Model analysis. The results reveal a rich spectrum of interactions of the hDAT N-terminus and distinguish different roles of the distal and proximal segments of the N-terminus, and interactions with the C-terminus, in modulating functional phenotypes not shared with the bacterial LeuT-like homologs."},

One class of mutants showing defects in signal transduction and radial patterning are those in sterol biosynthesis. The expectation is that sterol biosynthesis is a constitutive cell-autonomous process for the maintenance of basic cellular functions. The HYDRA1 (HYD1) gene of Arabidopsis encodes an essential sterol \u22068-\u22067 isomerase, and although hyd1 mutant seedlings are defective in radial patterning of several tissues, we show that the HYD1 gene is expressed primarily in the root epidermis. Cell type-specific transgenic activation of HYD1 transcription reveals that HYD1 expression in the epidermis of hyd1 null mutants is sufficient to rescue root patterning and growth. Unexpectedly, expression of HYD1 in the vascular tissues and root meristem, though not endodermis or pericycle, also leads to phenotypic rescue. Phenotypic rescue is associated with rescued patterning of the PIN1 and PIN2 auxin efflux carriers. The importance of the epidermis is in part due to its role as a site for tissue-specific sterol biosynthesis, and auxin is a candidate for a non-cell autonomous signal."},

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this persistent activity we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modeling. During the delay epoch, both membrane potential and population activity of ALM neurons funneled towards discrete endpoints related to specific movement directions. These endpoints were robust to transient shifts in ALM activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other endpoint, followed by incorrect actions. Our results are consistent with discrete attractor dynamics underlying short-term memory related to motor planning."},

Dynamical patterns are of particular interest, as evidenced by the proliferation and success of frequency domain methods that reveal structured spatiotemporal rhythmic brain activity. One drawback of such approaches, however, is the need to estimate spectral power, which limits the temporal resolution of classification. We propose an alternative method that enables classification of dynamical patterns with high temporal fidelity. The key feature of the method is a conversion of time-series into their temporal derivatives. By doing so, dynamically-coded information may be revealed in terms of geometric patterns in the phase space of the derivative signal. We derive a geometric classifier for this problem which simplifies into a straightforward calculation in terms of covariances. We demonstrate the relative advantages and disadvantages of the technique with simulated data and benchmark its performance with an EEG dataset of covert spatial attention. By mapping the weights anatomically we reveal a retinotopic organization of covert spatial attention. We especially highlight the ability of the method to provide strong group-level classification performance compared to existing benchmarks, while providing information that is synergistic to classical spectral-based techniques. The robustness and sensitivity of the method to noise is also examined relative to spectral-based techniques. The proposed classification technique enables decoding of dynamic patterns with high temporal resolution, performs favorably to benchmark methods, and facilitates anatomical inference."},

Specifically, we identified highroad through an in vivo RNAi based genetic interaction screen with one such folding defective Rhodopsin-1 mutant, ninaEG69D. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of highroad results in the stabilization of folding-defective mutant Rhodopsin-1 proteins, and acceleration of the age-related retinal degeneration phenotype of ninaEG69D mutants. Elevated highroad transcript levels are detected ninaEG69D flies, and interestingly, deprivation of retinoids in the fly diet blocks this effect.

Prenatal development and postnatal maturation are characterized by a cooperation of active CpG methylation and histone marks at cis-regulatory and genic regions to shape the cardiac myocyte transcriptome. In contrast, pathological gene expression in terminal heart failure is accompanied by changes in active histone marks without major alterations in CpG methylation and repressive chromatin marks. Notably, cis-regulatory regions in cardiac myocytes are significantly enriched for cardiovascular disease-associated variants. This study uncovers distinct layers of epigenetic regulation not only during prenatal development and postnatal maturation but also in diseased human cardiac myocytes."},

In these point mutation strategies we introduced the codon mutations, sgRNA site mutations and restriction sites which can be detected by AS-PCR with the primers matching their respective alleles in combination with a common primer. We employed the anti-sense asymmetric oligo design as the main optimization as well as phosphorothioate oligo modification and also observed that proximity of the mutation site to the Cas9 cut site improves the efficiency when knock-ins into different genes were compared. We improved the efficiencies of two tp53 knock-ins using anti-sense asymmetric ultramer oligos (126-nt in length with homology arms of 36 and 90 nucleotides, anti-sense to the sgRNA) by 3-10 fold, the optimizations which resulted in successful founders for both tp53 knock-ins with transmission rates of 20-40%. The initially low knock-in efficiency for tp53 mutants was likely due to the distance between the Cas9 cut site and mutations since cdh5 G767S knock-in located at the cut site had much higher founder identification and germline transmission rates. The phosphorothioate oligo modifications was used for a lamin A/C (lmna) knock-in strategy and it resulted in 40% overall improvement in knock-in efficiency and greater knock-in consistency. We also determined that AS-PCR detected false-positive knock-ins which constituted 25-80% of total in different strategies and developed a workflow to screen out the founders and F1 zebrafish carrying these undesirable modifications. In summary, we provide a complementary set of optimizations for CRISPR/Cas9-based ssODN knock-ins in zebrafish using a novel combination of methods."},

Furthermore, restoration of normal metabolic function is insufficient to halt the pathological changes in tendon due to obesity/T2DM. Mechanistically, Insulin Receptor (IR\u03b2) expression is increased in diabetic human tendon, while IR\u03b2 signaling is decreased in obese/T2DM murine tendons, suggesting altered IR\u03b2 signaling as a driver of diabetic tendinopathy. Conditional deletion of IR\u03b2 in tendon is not sufficient to induce diabetic tendinopathy, suggesting that obesity may be the predominant driver of this pathology.

The goal of this project was to measure the ability of a narrow forest windbreak to reduce downwind pollen fluxes from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a North American grass and model biofuels feedstock.  Switchgrass fields were established in two identical plots where one had a forest windbreak and the other was in an open (control) site.  Switchgrass reproduction, pollen dispersal, wind speed, and wind direction were measured over two years.   Daily release of switchgrass pollen peaked at 11:00-13:30 during a flowering period that lasted about 44 days.  The best estimate for switchgrass pollen source strength (PSS) was 141 billion pollen/season/hectare for fields planted at commercial densities.  The forest windbreak consistently decreased downwind switchgrass pollen concentrations by 333-20,000 fold compared to the control plot which had a 58-77 fold decrease due to downwind distance alone.  These results suggest that forest windbreaks could be used as a barrier to reduce pollen dispersal and gene flow from switchgrass and other crops."},

However, at present, there is no statistical method to determine whether observed changes in the overall composition are significant, or result from random variations between samples. Therefore researchers are limited to graphical descriptions. We describe a novel statistical method to determine whether or not observed differences in bacterial populations or their genes are significant. It can be used with data from shotgun metagenomics, 16S characterisation or qPCR. It can also be used for experimental design, to calculate the number of samples needed in future experiments. We show its application to two example data sets. The first is published data on bacterial communities and ARGs in the environment, in which we show that there are significant changes in both ARG and community composition. The second is a new data set on seasonality in bacterial communities and ARGs in hooves from four sheep. While the observed differences are not significant, we show that a minimum group size of eight sheep in a future experiment would provide sufficient power to observe significant changes, should the already observed changes be true. This method has broad uses for statistical testing and experimental design in experiments on changing microbiomes, including for studies on antimicrobial resistance."},

Based on comparative genomics, the duplication of the inner kinetochore proteins CenH3 and Cenp-C, which are interdependent in their roles of stablishing centromere identity and function, can be said to be rare in animals. Surprisingly, the Drosophila CenH3 homolog Cid underwent four independent duplication events during evolution. Particularly interesting are the highly diverged and subfunctionalized Cid1 and Cid5 paralogs of the Drosophila subgenus, which reveal that over one thousand Drosophila species encode two Cid genes, making those with a single copy a minority. Given that CenH3 and Cenp-C likely co-evolve as a functional unit, we investigated the molecular evolution of Cenp-C in species of Drosophila. We report yet another Cid duplication within the Drosophila subgenus and that not only Cid, but also Cenp-C is duplicated in the entire Drosophila subgenus. The Cenp-C paralogs, which we named Cenp-C1 and Cenp-C2, are highly divergent. The retention of key motifs involved in centromere localization by both Cenp-C1 and Cenp-C2 makes neofunctionalization unlikely. In contrast, the alternate conservation of some functional motifs between the proteins is highly indicative of subfunctionalization. Interestingly, both Cid5 and Cenp-C2 are male germline-biased and evolved adaptively. Our findings point towards a specific inner kinetochore composition to a specific context (i.e., spermatogenesis), which could prove valuable for the understanding of how the extensive kinetochore diversity is related to essential cellular functions."},

A recent class of decoding algorithms for fMRI data, stimulus-feature-based encoding models, is becoming increasingly popular for inferring the dimensions of neural representational spaces from stimulus-feature spaces. We argue that such inferences are not always valid, because decoding can occur even if the neural representational space and the stimulus-feature space use different representational schemes. This can happen when there is a systematic mapping between them, as shown by two simulations. In one simulation, we successfully decoded the binary representation of numbers from their decimal features. Since binary and decimal number systems use different representations, we cannot conclude that the binary representation encodes decimal features. In the second simulation, we successfully decoded the HSV color representation from the RGB representation of colors, even though these color spaces have different geometries and their dimensions have different interpretations. Detailed analysis of the predicted colors showed systematic deviations from the ground truth despite the high decoding accuracy, indicating that decoding accuracy on its own is not sufficient for making representational inferences. The same argument applies to the decoding of neural patterns from stimulus-feature spaces and we urge caution in inferring the nature of the neural code from such methods.

Twin studies estimate heritability of anxiety disorders to be between 30% - 60%, depending on specific disorder, age, and level of impairment. Although individual anxiety disorders are considered clinically distinct, they share much of their phenotypic and genetic variance, potentially reflecting an underlying liability distribution. The UK Biobank has collected symptom and disorder level anxiety data on 157,366 individuals across the UK who have contributed their genetic data. We used this dataset to investigate genome-wide associations, SNP based heritability, and genetic correlations in four anxiety phenotypes. These reflect population level current anxiety symptoms as a quantitative phenotype, and three case control phenotypes; severe current anxiety symptoms, probable lifetime generalised anxiety disorder and self-reported lifetime diagnosis of any anxiety disorder.  Probable lifetime generalised anxiety disorder and self-reported lifetime diagnosis of any anxiety disorder were meta-analysed with a comparable genome-wide association study of anxiety. Genetic analyses included unrelated Caucasian individuals of Western European ancestry. \n\nEstimates of SNP heritability from common variants ranged between 4% (for population level anxiety symptoms) and 32% (for probable generalised anxiety disorder), and all four UK Biobank anxiety phenotypes are highly genetically correlated. Three genome-wide significant loci were found to be associated with anxiety. Both rs3807866 located in the TMEM106B protein coding region on chromosome 7, and rs2996471 located in the NTRK2 protein coding region on chromosome 9, were associated with self-report of any lifetime anxiety diagnosis. An additional non characterised region on chromosome 9 was associated with both self report of any lifetime anxiety diagnosis (rs10809485), and severe anxiety symptoms (rs17189482). Meta-analysis with a comparable genome-wide association study of anxiety did not result in additional findings. This represents the largest genetic study of anxiety to date -  however larger sample sizes will be required to further examine the common genetic architecture underlying anxiety.

However, quantifying burst movements of small and agile aquatic animals (e.g., small teleost fish), such as during predatory behavior, or while fleeing, remains challenging. To capture the details of burst movements, accelerometers need to sample at a very high frequency, which will inevitably shorten the duration of the recording or increase the size of the device. To overcome this problem, we developed a high-frequency acceleration data-logger that can be triggered by a manually-defined acceleration threshold, thus allowing the selective measurement of animal burst movements. We conducted experiments under laboratory and field conditions to examine the performance of the logger. The laboratory experiment using red seabream (Pagrus major) showed that the new logger could measure the kinematics of their escape behaviors (i.e., body beat cycles and maximum acceleration values). The field experiment using free-swimming yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) showed that the loggers trigger correctly (i.e., of the 18 burst movements, 17 were recorded by the loggers). We suggest that this new logger can be applied to measure the burst movements of various small and agile animals, whose movements may be otherwise difficult to measure."},

Explicit tests of this relationship are limited to microbes where adaptation depends on the order of mutation accumulation, excluding standing genetic variation which is key for most natural species. When adaptation is determined by the amount of heritable genotype-by-environment fitness variance then genetic drift and/or maintenance of similarly fit genotypes may deter adaptation to slower the environmental changes. To address this hypothesis, we perform experimental evolution with self-fertilizing populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and develop a new inference model that follows pre-existing genotypes to describe natural selection in changing environments. Under an abrupt change, we find that selection rapidly increases the frequency of genotypes with high fitness in the most extreme environment. In contrast, under slower environmental change selection favors those genotypes that are worse at the most extreme environment. We further demonstrate with a second set of evolution experiments that, as a consequence of slower environmental change, population bottlenecks and small population sizes lead to the loss of beneficial genotypes, while maintenance of polymorphism impedes their fixation in large populations. Taken together, these results indicate that standing variation for genotype-by-environment fitness interactions alters the pace and outcome of adaptation under environmental change."},

Disruptions in any of these leads to a range of cerebellar phenotypes from ataxia to childhood tumors. Animal models have shown proper regulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is crucial for normal cerebellar architecture and increased signaling leads to cerebellar tumor formation. Primary cilia are known to be required for the proper regulation of multiple developmental signaling pathways, including Shh. One of the genes important for primary cilia form and function, is Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain 21B (Ttc21b). As Shh is a known mitogen in the cerebellum, we hypothesized loss of Ttc21b may contribute medulloblastoma formation. Surprisingly, Ttc21b ablation in Bergmann glia did not result in tumor formation but did cause ectopic granule cells to accumulate in the lower/posterior lobes of the cerebellum. Additionally, we found that Shh signaling was reduced in the cerebella of ablated animals rather than increased. When we ablated Ttc21b in the Purkinje cells, the phenotype was significantly less severe. These results suggest that Ttc21b expression is required for Bergmann glia structure and signaling in the developing cerebellum, and in some contexts, augments, rather than attenuates, Shh signaling."},

The key technology is to combine \"edit similarity\" in computer science with machine-learning clustering algorithms, where the former defines a \"distance\" between two strings as the minimal number of operations required to transform one string to the other. Our method requires no external references for pattern detection, and is tolerant of spike timing jitters and length irregularity in assembly sequences.

In plants, SSRs serve as a source of important class of molecular markers because of their hypervariabile and co-dominant nature, making them useful both for the genetic studies and   marker-assisted breeding. The SSRs are widespread throughout the genome of an organism, so that a large number of SSR datasets are available, most of them from either protein-coding regions or untranslated regions. It is only recently, that their occurrence within microRNAs (miRNA) genes has received attention. As is widely known, miRNA themselves are a class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with varying length of 19-22 nucleotides (nts), which play an important role in regulating gene expression in plants under different biotic and abiotic stresses (Gupta et al., 2015, and references therein). In this communication, we describe the results of a study, where miRNA-SSRs in full length pre-miRNA sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana were mined. The sequences were retrieved by annotations available at EnsemblPlants using BatchPrimer3 server with miRNA-SSR flanking primers found to be well distributed. Our analysis shows that miRNA-SSRs are relatively rare in protein-coding regions but abundant in non-coding region. All the observed 147 di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide SSRs were located in non-coding regions of all the 5 chromosomes of A. thaliana. While we confirm that miRNA-SSRs were commonly spread across the full length pre-miRNAs, we envisage that such studies would allow us to identify newly discovered markers for breeding studies."},

Using a large, longitudinal, multi-center database of de novo PD patients, we tested whether focal reductions in cortical thickness could be explained by disease spread from a subcortical \u201cdisease reservoir\u201d along the brain's connectome. PD patients (n=105) and matched controls (n=57) underwent T1-MRI at entry and one year later. Over this period, PD patients demonstrated significantly greater loss of cortical thickness than healthy controls in parts of the left occipital and bilateral frontal lobes and right somatomotor-sensory cortex. Cortical regions with greater connectivity (measured functionally or structurally) to a \u201cdisease reservoir\u201d evaluated via MRI at baseline demonstrated greater atrophy one year later. The atrophy pattern in the ventral frontal lobes resembled one described in certain cases of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, a multiple linear regression model suggested that cortical thinning was associated with impaired cognitive function at follow-up. Our findings suggest that disease propagation to the cortex in PD follows neural connectivity, and that disease spread to the cortex may herald the onset of cognitive impairment."},

We determine the evolutionarily stable levels of exploitation by pathogens under two scenarios: an unconstrained pathogen that expresses different exploitation rates within each host type as well as a pathogen constrained to express the same exploitation rate in each sex. We show that an unconstrained horizontally-transmitted parasite evolves to express the same sex-specific exploitation rate within each sex as it would in a host population composed entirely of hosts with that sex's resistance and intrinsic death rate. In contrast, the ESS exploitation rate of a constrained pathogen is affected by sex-differences in susceptibility and non-random contact patterns between host types that differ in resistance. As the amount of within-sex transmission increases, the ESS shifts closer to the optimum trait value in the more susceptible sex. Allowing for some degree of vertical transmission, the exploitation rate expressed in females (but not males) changes with contact pattern even in unconstrained pathogens. Differences in contact pattern and susceptibility play an important role in determining the ESS exploitation rate by shifting the reproductive value of each host type."},

We used a population genomics analysis including 95 genome sequences of the wheat blast pathogen Pyricularia graminis-tritici (Pygt) and other Pyricularia species to show that Pygt is a distinct, highly diverse pathogen species with a broad host range. We assayed 11 neutral SSR loci in 526 Pygt isolates sampled from wheat and other grasses distributed across the wheat-growing region of Brazil to estimate gene flow, assess the importance of sexual reproduction, and compare the genetic structures of Pygt populations infecting wheat and nearby grasses. Our results suggest a mixed reproductive system that includes sexual recombination as well as high levels of gene flow among regions, including evidence for higher gene flow from grass-infecting populations and into wheat-infecting populations than vice versa. The most common virulence groups were shared between the grass- and wheat-infecting Pygt populations, providing additional evidence for movement of Pygt between wheat fields and nearby grasses. Analyses of fruiting body formation found that proto-perithecia and perithecia developed on senescing stems of wheat and other grass hosts, suggesting that sexual reproduction occurs mainly during the saprotrophic phase of the disease cycle on dead residues. Phalaris canariensis (canarygrass) supported the fullest development of perithecia, suggesting it is a promising candidate for identifying the teleomorph in the field. Based on these findings, we formulated a more detailed disease cycle for wheat blast that includes an important role for grasses growing near wheat fields. Our findings strongly suggest that widely grown pasture grasses function as a major reservoir of wheat blast inoculum and provide a temporal and spatial bridge that connects wheat fields across Brazil."},

Relatively little is known regarding the neural generators and temporal dynamics of this arhythmical behaviour compared to rhythmical behaviour. Here we signal analytically separated the two types of activity and show in both monkeys and humans that oscillatory alpha power dynamically correlates with arhythmical activity. In a series of human studies probing the sensitivity of arhythmical activity to excitation-inhibition balance, we show that drugs interacting with GABA, NMDA, AMPA and 5HT receptors systematically flatten and steepen the profile of arhythmical activity. Similar modifications are seen in monkeys during general anaesthesia.  Surrogate data analysis demonstrates that arhythmical activity is generated by both linear and non-linear schemes, with non-linear effects emerging at critical boundaries. We propose a unifying model which can explain, the 1/f nature of electrophysiological spectra, their dynamic interaction with oscillatory rhythms as well as the sensitivity of 1/f activity to excitation-inhibition balance by considering electrophysiological spectra as being generated by a collection of stochastically perturbed damped oscillators having a distribution of relaxation rates."},

We then describe a BEAST2 package DENIM which based on this model, and which uses an approximation to sample from the posterior. The approximation is based on the assumption that migrations are rare, and it only samples from certain regions of the posterior which seem likely given this assumption. The method breaks down if there is a lot of migration. Using simulations, Leach et al 2014 showed migration causes problems for species tree inference using the multispecies coalescent when migration is present but ignored. We re-analyze this simulated data to explore DENIM's performance, and demonstrate substantial improvements over *BEAST. We also re-analyze an empirical data set.

Agrawal"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/203695 ", "abstract": "In many taxa, there is a conflict between the sexes over mating rate. The outcome of sexually antagonistic coevolution depends on the costs of mating and natural selection against sexually antagonistic traits. A sexually transmitted disease (STD) changes the relative strength of these costs. We study the three-way coevolutionary interaction between male persistence, female resistance, and STD virulence. By increasing the cost of mating, an STD escalates conflict between the sexes. The increased host mortality resulting from heightened sexual conflict, in turn, selects for increased STD virulence. Accelerating costs of the sexually antagonistic traits and diminishing benefits of virulence prevent unbounded escalation. Successful invasion by an STD becomes less likely if hosts are evolvable, especially if only the female trait can evolve. These results show that the evolution of both host and parasite traits operate differently in systems characterized by sexual conflict rather than by female mate choice."},

The failure of proper attachment results in muscle injury, which is the underlying cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), where mutations in the dystrophin gene disrupts the firm adhesion. In DMD patients, even moderate contraction causes damage, leading to progressive muscle degeneration. The damaged muscles are repaired through myogenesis. Consequently, myogenesis is highly active in DMD patients, and the repeated activation of myogenesis leads to the exhaustion of the myogenic stem cells. Therefore, approaches to reducing the risk of the exhaustion are to develop a treatment that strengthens the interaction between the sarcolemma and the basal lamina, and increases the efficiency of myogenesis. Galectin-3 is an oligosaccharide-binding protein and known to be involved in cell-cell interactions and cell-matrix interactions. Galectin-3 is expressed in myoblasts and skeletal muscle while its function in muscle remains elusive. In this study, we found evidence that galectin-3 and the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine, which increases the ligands (oligosaccharides) of galectin-3, promotes myogenesis in vitro. Moreover, in the mdx mouse model of DMD, treatment with N-acetylglucosamine increased the muscle force production.

Since the genetic control of hybrid sterility (HS) is complex, only a few HS genes have been identified so far, including Prdm9, the only known vertebrate HS gene. Prdm9 causes infertility in male hybrids between PWD/Ph and C57BL/6J mouse strains derived from Mus m. musculus and Mus m. domesticus subspecies. However, within species Prdm9 determines the sites of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and meiotic recombination hotspots. In sterile hybrids, different PRDM9 variants do not bind both homologous chromosomes equally, suggesting that the asymmetry or lack of symmetry of binding sites could explain the failure of meiotic chromosomes to synapse. To investigate the relation between asynapsis and meiotic arrest, we prepared intersubspecific hybrids with stretches of consubspecific homology on several pairs of autosomes and analyzed their ability to form synaptonemal complexes. Eight examined autosomes with more than 27 Mb of consubspecific homology fully restored their synapsis and we predicted that a minimum of two symmetric DSBs per chromosome are necessary for successful meiosis. Moreover, targeted suppression of asynapsis in four chromosomes most sensitive to asynapsis partially rescued spermatogenesis, thus pointing to chromosomal quality of hybrid sterility. We hypothesize that reduced ability of meiotic chromosomes to synapse, determined by impaired recombination between evolutionary diverged homologous chromosomes could function as an ancient mechanism of hybrid sterility occurring in various sexually reproducing species."},

Forsdyke"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/170860 ", "abstract": "Mechanisms initiating a branching process that can lead to new species are broadly classified as chromosomal and genic. Chromosomal mechanisms were supported by breeding studies involving exchanges of individual chromosomes between mouse subspecies. There were also studies of the rapidly mutating mouse PR/SET-domain 9 (prdm9) gene, which encodes PRDM9, a protein targeting DNA recombination hotspots. When PRDM9 is bound symmetrically with equal strength, the meiotic repair of mutations in one parental strand, based on information on the allelic strand (conversion), would seem to be unbiased in discriminating between strands. So mismatches detected between pairing paternal and maternal DNA strands (heteroduplexes) would undergo unbiased conversions (to homoduplexes). This would leave uncertainty on whether a mutation had been corrected or compounded. However, a hypothetical tagging of mismatch regions, so that both strands are epigenetically marked as uncertain, would make it possible over numerous generations for mutations to be corrected (biased conversions) whenever asymmetry is detected. Thus variation would decrease and members of a species would remain within its bounds. Intriguingly, new experimental studies show that, when chromosomally interpreted, PRDM9 also works through asymmetrical epigenetic labelling to confine members to species bounds. To the extent that the experimentally observed and hypothetical anti-speciation asymmetries can be related, chromosomal mechanisms are further supported."},

The formation of new memories is assumed to be orchestrated by neuronal oscillations, the rhythmic synchronization of neuronal activity within and across cell assemblies. Specifically, successful encoding of novel information is associated with increased theta oscillations (3-8Hz) and theta coupled gamma activity (40-120Hz), and a decrease in alpha oscillations (8-12Hz). However, given the correlative nature of neurophysiological recordings, the causal role of neuronal rhythms in human memory encoding is still unclear. Here, we experimentally enhance the formation of novel memories by a visual brain stimulation at an individually adjusted theta frequency, in contrast to the stimulation at an individual alpha frequency. Critically, the memory entrainment effect by the theta stimulation was not explained by theta power per se, but was driven by visually evoked theta-gamma coupling in wide spread cortical networks. These findings provide first evidence for a functional role of the theta rhythm and the theta-gamma neuronal code in human episodic memory. Yet more strikingly, the entrainment of mnemonic network mechanisms by a simplistic visual stimulation technique provides a proof of concept that internal rhythms align with visual pacemakers, which can entrain complex cognitive functions in the wake human brain."},

Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), one of the mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent lysine deacylases, catalyzes the removal of fatty acylation from K-Ras4a. We further demonstrate that SIRT2-mediated lysine defatty-acylation promotes endomembrane localization of K-Ras4a, enhances its interaction with A-Raf, and thus promotes cellular transformation.

These parcellations may be inferred from existing atlases (e.g. Desikan) or sets of rules, as would do a neuroanatomist for lobes, but also directly driven from the data (e.g. functional or structural connectivity) with minimum a priori. In the present work, we aimed at using the intrinsic geometric information contained in the eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami Operator to obtain parcellations of the cortical surface based only on its description by triangular meshes. We proposed a framework adapted from spectral clustering, general in scope and suitable for the co-parcellation of a group of subjects. We applied it to a dataset of 62 adults, optimized it and revealed a striking agreement between parcels produced by this unsupervised clustering and Freesurfer lobes (Desikan atlas), which cannot be explained by chance. Already suitable by itself, this spectral analysis of lobes (Spanol) could conveniently be fitted into a multimodal pipeline for optimized and fast lobar segmentation.

Here, using a simple kinetic model of Pol II transcription calibrated by in vivo measured rate constants of different transcription steps in mammalian cells, we demonstrate how this non-linearity can be explained by multi-step transcriptional regulation. Moreover, we show how multi-step enhancement of Pol II transcription can increase mRNA production while leaving Pol II densities unaffected. Our theoretical analysis not only recapitulates experimentally observed Pol II densities upon two-fold up-regulation but also points to a limitation of inferences based on Pol II profiles from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) or global run-on assays."},

The dataset included a number of subjects with a substantial Finnish contribution to ancestry. We have reanalysed the same dataset after removal of these subjects and we have also included non-singleton variants of all types using a weighted burden test which assigns higher weights to variants predicted to have a greater effect on protein function. We investigated the same 31 gene sets as previously and also 1454 GO gene sets. The reduced dataset consisted of 4225 cases and 5834 controls. No individual variants or genes were significantly enriched in cases but 13 out of the 31 gene sets were significant after Bonferroni correction and the \"FMRP targets\" set produced a signed log p value (SLP) of 7.1. The gene within this set with the highest SLP, equal to 3.4, was FYN, which codes for a tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates glutamate metabotropic receptors and ionotropic NMDA receptors, thus modulating their trafficking, subcellular distribution and function. Two of the subunits of the NMDA receptor which are substrates of FYN are coded for by GRIN1 (SLP=1.7) and GRIN2B (SLP=2.1). Of note, for some sets there was a substantial enrichment of non-singleton variants. Of 1454 GO gene sets, 3 were significant after Bonferroni correction. Identifying specific genes and variants will depend on genotyping them in larger samples and/or demonstrating that they cosegregate with illness within pedigrees."},

Saravanan", "Keith Dunker", "Sankaran Krishnaswamy"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/203547 ", "abstract": "More than sixty prediction methods for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have been developed over the years, many of which are accessible on the world-wide web. Nearly, all of these predictors give balanced accuracies in the ~65% to ~80% range. Since predictors are not perfect, further studies are required to uncover the role of amino acid residues in native IDP as compared to predicted IDP regions. In the present work, we make use of sequences of 100% predicted IDP regions, false positive disorder predictions, and experimentally determined IDP regions to distinguish the characteristics of native versus predicted IDP regions. A higher occurrence of asparagine is observed in sequences of native IDP regions but not in sequences of false positive predictions of IDP regions. The occurrences of certain combinations of amino acids at the pentapeptide level provide a distinguishing feature in the IDPs with respect to globular proteins. The distinguishing features presented in this paper provide insights into the sequence fingerprints of amino acid residues in experimentally-determined as compared to predicted IDP regions. These observations and additional work along these lines should enable the development of improvements in the accuracy of disorder prediction algorithm."},

Reproduction can drain these stem cell pools, imposing a physiological cost with subsequent negative effects on somatic maintenance functions. In the freshwater cnidarian Hydra oligactis both asexual (budding) and sexual reproductive modes (production of resting eggs) are present, and both of these are dependent on a common pool of interstitial stem cells. Resting eggs tolerate abiotic conditions which neither the parental animals, nor asexual offspring can survive (e.g. freezing). Therefore, when facing unfavorable conditions and increased mortality risk, hydra polyps are expected to show higher differentiation of interstitial stem cells into germ cells (i.e. sexual reproduction), compared to other cell types needed for selfmaintenance or asexual reproduction. Here, by comparing sexually and asexually reproducing individuals to non-reproductives, we studied the physiological costs of reproduction (size of interstitial stem cell pools, their somatic derivatives and regeneration rate, which is dependent on these cell types) in H. oligactis polyps from a free-living Hungarian population prior to the onset of winter. Sexual individuals (but not asexuals) were characterized by significantly smaller interstitial stem cell pools, fewer somatic derivatives (nematoblasts involved in food capture) and lower regeneration ability compared to non-reproductives. We also found a negative correlation between germ cell counts and stem cell numbers in males (but not in females). These results show that the physiological costs of reproduction are higher for sexual individuals. They also suggest that increased differentiation of stem cells into gametes might limit investment into somatic functions in hydra polyps. Exhaustion of cellular resources (stem cells) could be a major mechanism behind the extreme post-reproductive senescence observed in this species."},

Reduced expression of Csde1 in healthy erythroblasts impaired their proliferation and differentiation, which suggests an important role for Csde1 in erythropoiesis. To investigate the cellular pathways controlled by Csde1 in erythropoiesis, we identified the transcripts that physically associate with Csde1 in erythroid cells. These mainly encoded proteins involved in ribogenesis, mRNA translation and protein degradation, but also proteins associated with the mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitosis. Crispr/Cas9-mediated deletion of the first cold shock domain of Csde1 affected RNA expression and/or protein expression of Csde1-bound transcripts. For instance, protein expression of Pabpc1 was enhanced while Pabpc1 mRNA expression was reduced indicating more efficient translation of Pabpc1 followed by negative feedback on mRNA stability. Overall, the effect of reduced Csde1 function on mRNA stability and translation of Csde1-bound transcripts was modest. Clones with complete loss of Csde1, however, could not be generated. We suggest that Csde1 is involved in feed-back control in protein homeostasis and that it dampens stochastic changes in mRNA expression."},

Transposable elements can promote hybridity through maternal small RNA, and have been postulated to regulate dosage response via neighboring imprinted genes. Here, we show that a highly conserved microRNA in plants, miR845, targets the tRNAMet primer-binding site (PBS) of LTR-retrotransposons in Arabidopsis pollen, and triggers the accumulation of 21 to 22-nucleotide small RNA in a dose dependent fashion via RNA polymerase IV. We show that these epigenetically activated small-interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) mediate hybridization barriers between diploid seed parents and tetraploid pollen parents (the triploid block), and that natural variation for miR845 may account for endosperm balance allowing formation of triploid seeds. Targeting the PBS with small RNA is a common mechanism for transposon control in mammals and plants, and provides a uniquely sensitive means to monitor chromosome dosage and imprinting in the developing seed."},

Understanding the composition and dynamics of the pneumococcal population is crucial, as these factors influence the observed distribution of disease in the human population. Competition among bacterial members of the nasopharynx is believed to be mediated by bacteriocins: antimicrobial toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit growth of other bacteria. The role of bacteriocins as weapons of defence also makes bacteriocins attractive candidates for the development of new antibiotics. Here, by screening >6,200 pneumococcal genomes, we identified 14 newly-discovered bacteriocin clusters, tripling the number of known bacteriocins among pneumococci. We provide evidence that many of the bacteriocin genes are transcriptionally active when the cell is induced by external stress. Using a large global and historical dataset of pneumococci isolated from 1916-2009, we determined the prevalence, molecular epidemiology and co-occurrence patterns of the identified bacteriocin clusters. Our study demonstrated extraordinary bacteriocin diversity among the pneumococcal genomes and revealed several genome hotspots for the integration of bacteriocin clusters. These findings fundamentally change our view of bacteriocins and nasopharyngeal competition among pneumococci."},

During interactions with objects, information from kinesthetic and tactile sensors is used to estimate the forces acting on the limbs. These enable perceptions of the mechanical properties of objects to form, and the creation of internal models to predict the consequences of interactions with these objects such as feedforward grip-force adjustments to prevent slippage. Artificial tactor displacement-induced skin stretch can produce a linear additive effect on stiffness perception, but it remains unclear how artificial stretch affects the control of grip force. Here, we used a robotic device and a custom-built skin-stretch to manipulate kinesthetic and tactile information. Using a stiffness discrimination task, we found that adding artificial tactile feedback to a kinesthetic force can create the illusion of touching a harder spring which affects both perception and action. The magnitude of the illusion is linearly related to the amplitude of the applied stretch. We also isolated the contribution of tactile stimulation to the predictive and reactive components of grip force adjustment, and found that unlike other cases of perceptual illusions, the predictive grip force is modulated consistently with the perceptual tactile-induced illusion. These results have major implications for the design of tactile interfaces across a variety of touch applications such as wearable haptic devices, teleoperations, robot-assisted surgery, and prosthetics."},

The \"triploid block\" is a classical example of dosage regulation in plants that establishes a reproductive barrier between species differing in chromosome number. This barrier acts in the endosperm, an ephemeral tissue that nurtures the developing embryo and induces the abortion of hybrid seeds through a yet unknown mechanism. Interploidy hybridizations involving diploid (2x) maternal parents and tetraploid (4x) pollen donors cause failure in endosperm cellularization, leading to embryo arrest. Here we show that paternal epigenetically activated small interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) are responsible for the establishment of the triploid block-associated seed abortion in Arabidopsis thaliana. Paternal loss of the plant-specific RNA polymerase IV suppressed easiRNA formation and rescued triploid seeds by restoring small RNA-directed DNA methylation at transposable elements (TEs), correlating with reduced expression of paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs). We propose that excess of paternally derived easiRNAs in diploid pollen prevents establishment of DNA methylation, leading to triploid seed abortion. Our data further suggest that easiRNAs form a quantitative signal for chromosome number and their balanced dosage is required for post-fertilization genome stability and seed viability."},

However, current state-of-the-art computational methods do not yield significantly better predictions of rare ADRs than random guessing. We present a novel method, based on the theory of \"compressed sensing\", which can accurately predict serious side-effects of candidate and market drugs. Not only is our method able to infer new chemical-ADR associations using existing noisy, biased, and incomplete databases, but our data also demonstrates that the accuracy of our approach in predicting a serious adverse reaction (ADR) for a candidate drug increases with increasing knowledge of other ADRs associated with the drug. In practice, this means that as the candidate drug moves up the different stages of clinical trials, the prediction accuracy of our method will increase accordingly. Thus, the compressed sensing based computational method reported here represents a major advance in predicting severe rare ADRs, and may facilitate reducing the time and cost of drug discovery and development."},

Here, we investigate the biochemistry, metabolic pathways, and thermodynamics corresponding to OC oxidation in the Columbia River corridor using ultra-high resolution C characterization. We leverage natural vegetative differences to encompass variation in terrestrial C inputs. Our results suggest that decreases in terrestrial C deposition associated with diminished riparian vegetation induce oxidation of physically-bound OC. We also find that contrasting metabolic pathways oxidize OC in the presence and absence of vegetation and -- in direct conflict with the priming concept -- that inputs of water-soluble and thermodynamically favorable terrestrial OC protects bound-OC from oxidation. In both environments, the most thermodynamically favorable compounds appear to be preferentially oxidized regardless of which OC pool microbiomes metabolize. In turn, we suggest that the extent of riparian vegetation causes sediment microbiomes to locally adapt to oxidize a particular pool of OC, but that common thermodynamic principles govern the oxidation of each pool (i.e., water-soluble or physically-bound). Finally, we propose a mechanistic conceptualization of OC oxidation along terrestrial-aquatic interfaces that can be used to model heterogeneous patterns of OC loss under changing land cover distributions."},

We aimed to develop diagnostic scoring systems to better predict the presence of 3GC-R EB as a cause of bacteraemia.  Methods: A retrospective nested case-control study was performed that included patients \u226518 years in whom blood cultures were obtained and intravenous antibiotics were initiated. Each patient with 3GC-R EB bacteraemia was matched to four control infection episodes within the same hospital, based on blood culture date and onset location (community or hospital). Starting from 32 described clinical risk factors at infection onset, selection strategies were used to derive scoring systems for the probability of community- and hospital-onset 3GC-R EB bacteraemia.  Results: 3GC-R EB bacteraemia occurred in 90 of 22,506 (0.4%) community-onset and in 82 of 8,110 (1.0%) hospital-onset infections, and these cases were matched to 360 community-onset and 328 hospital-onset control episodes, respectively. The derived community-onset and hospital-onset scoring system consisted of 6 and 9 predictors, respectively, with c-statistics of 0.807 (95% confidence interval 0.756-0.855) and 0.842 (0.794-0.887). With selected score cutoffs, the models identified 3GC-R EB bacteraemia with equal sensitivity as existing guidelines, but reduced the proportion of patients classified as at risk for 3GC-R EB bacteraemia (i.e. eligible for empiric carbapenem therapy) with 40% in patients with community-onset and 49% in patients with hospital-onset infection.

This fingerprinting approach was applied to a large sample (N=841) of subjects from the Human Connectome Project, revealing a reliable degree of between-subject correlation in the local connectome fingerprints, with a relatively complex, low-dimensional substructure. Using a cross-validated, high-dimensional regression analysis approach, we derived local connectome phenotype (LCP) maps that could reliably predict a subset of subject attributes measured, including demographic, health and cognitive measures. These LCP maps were highly specific to the attribute being predicted but also sensitive to correlations between attributes.

While these fluctuations, most prominently those of the default mode network, have been linked to cognitive function, it remains unclear whether they result from random noise or whether they index a non-stationary process which could be described as state switching. In this study, we use a sliding windows approach to relate temporal dynamics of RSNs to global modulations in correlation and BOLD variance. We compare empirical data, phase-randomized surrogate data, and data simulated with a stationary model. We find that RSN time courses exhibit a large amount of coactivation in all three cases, and that the modulations in their activity are closely linked to global dynamics of the underlying BOLD signal. We find that many properties of the observed fluctuations in FC and BOLD, including their ranges and their correlations amongst each other, are explained by fluctuations around the average FC structure. However, we also encounter interesting characteristics that are not explained in this way.

Here, we synthesize evidence for local adaptation in trees by summarizing 129 common garden experiments across 20 genera of tree species that describe levels of heritability, differentiation of quantitative genetic variation (QST), and/or QST-FST comparisons. Given the abundant evidence for local adaptation, we discuss theoretical expectations for adaptive genetic architectures and contextualize progress in trees by synthesizing 52 genotype-phenotype association studies across ten genera. Our survey suggests that most tree traits generally exhibit considerably high heritability (mean narrow sense heritability = 0.367, mean broad sense heritability  = 0.430), that underlying genetic variation is often structured across populations (mean QST = 0.243) and is significantly greater than FST in 69% of comparisons across the literature. Despite widespread evidence for local adaptation acting on abundant, heritable genetic variation, we find that single-locus associations explain only a small proportion of the phenotypic variation, often with small estimated per-locus effects (mean r-squared = 0.039). Together, these results suggest differential selection across populations often acts on tree phenotypes underlain by polygenic architectures consisting of numerous small to moderate effect loci.

Whether and how these changes determine cell fate remains unclear. We have uncovered a mechanism regulating NPC acetylation to direct cell fate after asymmetric division in budding yeast. The lysine deacetylase Hos3 associates specifically with daughter cell NPCs during mitosis to delay cell cycle entry (Start). Hos3-dependent deacetylation of nuclear basket and central channel nucleoporins establishes daughter cell-specific nuclear accumulation of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 during anaphase and perinuclear silencing of the CLN2 gene in the following G1 phase. Hos3-dependent coordination of both events restrains Start in daughter but not in mother cells. We propose that deacetylation modulates transport-dependent and -independent functions of NPCs, leading to differential cell cycle progression in mother and daughter cells. Similar mechanisms might regulate NPC functions in specific cell types and/or cell cycle stages in multicellular organisms."},

Yet, a thorough understanding of the host response to these viruses is still lacking, in part because conventional approaches do not enable one to resolve heterogeneity in viral loads and cellular response between different individual cells. Here we present viscRNA-Seq (virus-inclusive single-cell RNA-Seq), an approach to probe the whole host transcriptome together with intracellular viral RNA at the single cell level that is applicable to both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated viruses. We applied viscRNA-Seq to monitor dynamics of dengue and Zika virus infection in cultured cells and discovered a high heterogeneity of intracellular viral load which affects the virus-triggered host response. The single-cell distributions of both intracellular viral load and gene expression indicate that mean values measured in conventional bulk assays tend to over-represent highly infected cells. When these effects are accounted for, we discovered that several host factors show complex dynamics and a high degree of specificity for either virus. These host factors include both known and novel members of the endoplasmic reticulum translocon and proteins involved in signal peptide processing and intracellular membrane trafficking. We used loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to validate the viscRNA-Seq hits and discovered novel proviral and antiviral factors. Overall, viscRNA-Seq is a powerful approach to quantitatively assess the complex interplay between virus and host at the single cell level and at a genome-wide scale, and to elucidate the cellular pathways involved in viral infection."},

The recent availability of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results have made the polygenic risk score (PRS) approach a powerful way to perform genetic prediction and identify genetic overlap among phenotypes.  Methods and findings: Here we use the PRS method to assess evidence for shared genetic aetiology across hundreds of traits within a single epidemiological study, the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). We replicate numerous recent findings, such as a genetic association between Alzheimers disease and lipid levels, while the depth of phenotyping in the NFBC1966 highlights a range of novel significant genetic associations between traits.  Conclusions: This study illustrates the power in taking a hypothesis-free approach to the study of shared genetic aetiology between human traits and diseases. It also demonstrates the potential of the PRS method to provide important biological insights using only a single well-phenotyped epidemiological study of moderate sample size (~5k), with important advantages over evaluating genetic correlations from GWAS summary statistics only."},

To examine the canine neurobiological response to observed interactions between a human and another dog, we collected fMRI data from dogs while they watched their owner feed a realistic fake dog or deposit food in a bucket. Given the likelihood that arousal and affective state may contribute to responses to observed social situations, we examined the relationship between amygdala activation in these two conditions and an independent measure of aggressive temperament from the C-BARQ scale. Dogs rated more aggressive showed significantly higher activation in the fake-dog versus bucket condition. This finding suggests a neurobiological mechanism mediated by the amygdala for dog-directed aggression, especially when their owner interacts with another dog. Such a mechanism may have some parallels to human jealousy. Further, it adds to a growing body of evidence that specific neurobiological responses correlate with canine temperament and can be a predictor of future behavior. We also found evidence that the amygdala response habituates with repeated observed interactions. This suggests value in exposure-based interventions for potentially aggressive dogs."},

Behavioral, computational, and neurobiological evidence has suggested that these two effects of practice might be related; however, it remains unclear whether skill improvement and habit formation are two aspects of the same learning process, or are separate processes that occur in parallel. Using a visuomotor association task in human participants, we directly assessed the effects of practice on both the speed of response selection, and whether or not response selection became habitual. We found that response selection could become fully habitual within four days of practice. In contrast, the speed of response selection improved continuously with practice over twenty days.

Such 'urgency' signal components, defined by their independence from sensory evidence, are observed even before evidence is presented and can grow dynamically during decision formation. Is urgency applied globally, or are there adjustments of a distinct nature applied at different processing levels? Using a novel multi-level recording paradigm, we show that dynamic urgency impacting cortical action-preparation signals is echoed downstream in electromyographic indices of muscle activation, but does not directly influence upstream cortical levels. A motor-independent representation of cumulative evidence reached lower pre-response levels under conditions of greater motor-level urgency, paralleling a decline in choice accuracy. At the sensory level itself, we find a boost in differential evidence, which is correlated with changes in pupil size and acts to alleviate, rather than contribute to, the overall accuracy cost under speed pressure."},

In addition, some studies indicated that other host cell factors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor might contribute to the initial virus-cell contact and further downstream signaling. Here we use two complementary methods, glycan arrays and single-virus force spectroscopy (SVFS) to compare influenza virus receptor specificity with actual host cell binding. Unexpectedly, our study reveals that HAs receptor binding preference does not necessarily reflect virus-cell specificity. We propose SVFS as a tool to elucidate the cell binding preference of IAV thereby including the complex environment of sialylated receptors within the plasma membrane of living cells."},

Shamsuzzaman", "Brian Gregory", "Vincent Bruno", "Lasse Lindahl"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/203356 ", "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is an essential metabolic process of a growing cell. Cells need to continuously synthesize new ribosomes in order to make new proteins than can support building biomass and cell division. It is obvious that in the absence of ribosome biogenesis, cell growth will stop and cell division will stall. However, it is not clear whether cell growth stops due to reduced protein synthesis capacity (translational stress) or due to activation of signaling specific to ribosome biogenesis abnormalities (ribosomal stress). To understand the signaling pathways leading to cell cycle arrest under ribosomal and translational stress conditions, we performed time series RNA-seq experiments of cells at different time of ribosomal and translational stress. We found that expression of ribosomal protein genes follow different course over the time of these two stress types. In addition, ribosomal stress is sensed early in the cell, as early as 2hr. Up-regulation of genes responsive to oxidative stress and over representation of mRNAs for transcription factors responsive to stress was detected in cell at 2hr of ribosomal protein depletion. Even though, we detected phenotypic similarities in terms of cell separation and accumulation in G1 phase cells during inhibition of ribosome formation and ribosome function, different gene expression patterns underlie these phenotypes, indicating a difference in causalities of these phenotypes. Both ribosomal and translational stress show common increased expression of stress responsive gene expression, like Crz1 target gene expression, signature of oxidative stress response and finally membrane or cell wall instability. We speculate that cell membrane and cell wall acts as major stress sensor in the cell and adjust cellular metabolism accordingly. Any change in membrane lipid composition, or membrane protein oxidation, or decrease or increase in intracellular turgor pressure causes stress in cell membrane. Cell membrane or cell wall stress activates and/or inactivates specific signaling pathway which triggers stress responsive gene expression and adaptation of cellular behavior accordingly."},

Current kinship identification models incorporate STR size profiles to statistical models that do not adequately depict genetic inheritance beyond the first degree, or machine learning algorithms that are prone to over optimization and requiring similar training data. This work presents an alternative approach using a com- putational framework that incorporates the inheritance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between specific relationships(patent pending)[1]. The impact of SNP panel size on predictions is visualized in terms of the distribution of allelic differences between individuals. The confidence of predictions is made by calculating log likelihood ratios.

This physiological leftward spatial bias may depend on hemispheric asymmetries in the organization of attentional networks, but the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here we modeled relevant aspects of the ventral and dorsal attentional networks (VAN and DAN) of the human brain. First, we demonstrated pseudoneglect in visual search in 101 right-handed psychology students. Participants consistently tended to start the task from a left-sided item, thus showing pseudoneglect. Second, we trained populations of simulated neurorobots to perform a similar task, by using a genetic algorithm. The neurorobots' behavior was controlled by artificial neural networks, which simulated the human VAN and DAN in the two brain hemispheres. Neurorobots differed in the connectional constraints that were applied to the anatomy and function of the attention networks. Results indicated that (1) neurorobots provided with a biologically plausible hemispheric asymmetry of the VAN-DAN connections, as well as with inter-hemispheric inhibition, displayed the best match with human data; however, (2) anatomical asymmetry per se was not sufficient to generate pseudoneglect; in addition, the VAN must have an excitatory influence on the ipsilateral DAN; (3) neurorobots provided with bilateral competence in the VAN but without inter-hemispheric inhibition failed to display pseudoneglect. These findings provide a proof of concept of the causal link between connectional asymmetries and pseudoneglect, and specify important biological constraints that result in physiological asymmetries of human behavior."},

We found that cell division is not required for elongation of the early Drosophila follicular epithelium, but does drive the tissue towards optimal geometric packing. To increase tissue regularity, cell divisions are oriented in the planar axis, along the direction of tissue expansion. Planar division orientation is governed by apico-cortical tension, which aligns with tissue expansion but not with interphase cell shape elongation. Hertwig's Rule, which holds that cell elongation determines division orientation, is therefore broken in this tissue. We tested whether this observation could be explained by anisotropic activity of the conserved Pins/Mud spindle-orienting machinery, which controls division orientation in the apical-basal axis. We found that Pins/Mud does not participate in planar division orientation. Rather, tension translates into planar division orientation in a manner dependent on Canoe/Afadin, which links actomyosin to adherens junctions. These findings demonstrate that division orientation in different axes - apical-basal and planar - is controlled by distinct, independent mechanisms in a proliferating epithelium."},

Recent studies suggest that m6A deposition and proteins involved in the m6A pathway play a diverse set of roles in either restricting or modulating the lifecycles of select viruses. Here, we report that m6A levels are significantly increased in cells infected with the oncogenic human DNA virus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Transcriptome-wide m6A-sequencing of the KSHV-positive renal carcinoma cell line iSLK.219 during lytic reactivation revealed the presence of m6A across multiple kinetic classes of viral transcripts, and a concomitant decrease in m6A levels across much of the host transcriptome. However, we found that depletion of the m6A machinery had differential pro- and anti-viral impacts on viral gene expression depending on the cell-type analyzed. In iSLK.219 cells the pathway functioned in a pro-viral manner, as depletion of the m6A writer METTL3 and the reader YTHDF2 significantly impaired viral lytic cycle progression and virion production. This defect could be attributed to their roles in the post-transcriptional accumulation of the major viral lytic transactivator ORF50, which is m6A modified. In contrast, although the ORF50 mRNA was also m6A modified in KSHV infected B cells, ORF50 expression was instead increased upon depletion of METTL3, YTHDF1, or, to a lesser extent, YTHDF2. These results highlight that the m6A pathway is centrally involved in regulating KSHV gene expression, and underscore how the outcome of this dynamically regulated modification can vary significantly between cell types."},

Play behaviour is diverse and multi-faceted. A challenge for current research is to converge on a common definition and measurement system for play - whether examined at a behavioural, cognitive or neurological level. Combining these different approaches in a multi-level analysis could yield significant advances in understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms of play, and provide the basis for developing biologically-grounded play models. However, there is currently no integrated framework for conducting a multi-level analysis of play that spans brain, cognition and behaviour. The proposed neuropsychological coding framework uses grounded and observable behaviours along three neuropsychological dimensions (sensorimotor, cognitive and socio-emotional), to compute inferences about playful behaviour and related social interactional states. Here, we illustrate the sensitivity and utility of the proposed coding framework using two contrasting dyadic corpora (N=5) of mother-infant object-oriented interactions during experimental conditions that were either conducive (Condition 1) or non-conducive (Condition 2) to the emergence of playful behaviour. We find that the framework accurately identifies the modal form of social interaction as being either playful (Condition 1) or non-playful (Condition 2), and further provides useful insights about differences in the quality of social interaction and temporal synchronicity within the dyad. In conclusion, here, we present a novel neuropsychological framework for analysing the continuous time-evolution of adult-infant play patterns, underpinned by biologically informed state coding along sensorimotor, cognitive and socioemotional dimensions. We expect that the proposed framework will have wide utility amongst researchers wishing to employ an integrated, multi-level approach to the study of play, and lead towards a greater understanding of the neuroscientific basis of play and may yield insights into a new biologically-grounded taxonomy of play interactions."},

However, in the mammalian embryo, morphogen concentrations change rapidly compared to the time for making cell fate decisions. It is unknown how changing ligand levels are interpreted, and whether the precise timecourse of ligand exposure plays a role in cell fate decisions. Nodal and BMP4 are morphogens crucial for gastrulation in vertebrates. Each pathway has distinct receptor complexes that phosphorylate specific signal transducers, known as receptor-Smads, which then complex with the shared cofactor Smad4 to activate target genes. Here we show in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that the response to BMP4 signaling indeed is determined by the ligand concentration, but that unexpectedly, the expression of many mesodermal targets of Activin/Nodal depends on rate of concentration increase. In addition, we use live imaging of hESCs with GFP integrated at the endogenous SMAD4 locus to show that a stem cell model for the human embryo generates a wave of Nodal signaling. Cells experience rapidly increasing Nodal specifically in the region of mesendoderm differentiation. We also demonstrate that pulsatile stimulation with Activin induces repeated strong signaling and enhances mesoderm differentiation. Our results break with the paradigm of concentration-dependent differentiation and demonstrate an important role for morphogen dynamics in the cell fate decisions associated with mammalian gastrulation. They suggest a highly dynamic picture of embryonic patterning where some cell fates depend on rapid concentration increase rather than absolute levels, and point to ligand dynamics as a new dimension to optimize protocols for directed stem cell differentiation."},

We found that the modal intron length range of 60-70 nt represents a local maximum of splicing rates, but that much longer exon-defined introns are spliced even faster and more accurately. Surprisingly, we observed low variation in splicing rates across introns in the same gene, suggesting the presence of gene-level influences, and we identified multiple gene level variables associated with splicing rate.

To address this issue, researchers have proposed sequential drug therapies with which the resistance developed by a previous drug can be relieved by the next one, a concept called collateral sensitivity. The optimal times of these switches, however, remains unknown. We therefore developed a dynamical model and study the effect of sequential therapy on heterogeneous tumors comprised of resistant and sensitivity cells. A pair of drugs (DrugA, DrugB) are utilized and switched in turn within the therapy schedule. Assuming that they are collaterally sensitive to each other, we classified cancer cells into two groups, and explored their population dynamics: A_R and B_R, each of which is subpopulation of cells resistant to the indicated drug and concurrently sensitive to the other. Based on a system of ordinary differential equations for A_R and B_R, we determined that the optimal treatment strategy consists of two stages: initial stage in which a chosen better drug is utilised until a specific time point, T, and afterward; a combination of the two drugs with relative durations (i.e. f \u0394t-long for DrugA and (1-f)\u0394t-long for DrugB with 0\u2264f\u22641 and \u0394t\u22650). Of note, we prove that the initial period, in which the first drug is administered, T, is shorter than the period in which it remains effective in lowing total population, contrary to current clinical intuition. We further analyzed the relationship between population makeup, ApB=A_R/B_R, and effect of each drug. We determine a specific makeup, ApB*, at which the two drugs are equally effective. While the optimal strategy is applied, ApB is changing monotonically to ApB* and then remains at ApB* thereafter. Beyond our analytic results, we explored an individual based stochastic model and presented the distribution of extinction times for the classes of solutions found. Taken together, our results suggest opportunities to improve therapy scheduling in clinical oncology."},

It remains to be seen, however, if the propagation of BOLD activity can also relate to the brain anatomical structure at a more local scale. Here, we hypothesized that BOLD propagation reflect structured neural activity across early visual field maps. To explore this hypothesis, we characterize the propagation of BOLD activity across V1, V2 and V3 using a modeling approach that aims to disentangle the contributions of local activity and directed interactions in shaping BOLD propagation. It does so by estimating the effective connectivity (EC) and the excitability of a noise-diffusion network to reproduce the spatiotemporal covariance structure of the data. We apply our approach to 7T fMRI recordings acquired during resting state (RS) and visual field mapping (VFM). Our results reveal different EC interactions and changes in cortical excitability in RS and VFM, and point to a reconfiguration of feedforward and feedback interactions across the visual system. We conclude that the propagation of BOLD activity has functional relevance, as it reveals directed interactions and changes in cortical excitability in a state-dependent manner."},

Life-style change of diet is largely unsuccessful and exercise is painful, uncomfortable and difficult for people with diabesity, cardiorespiratory and joint diseases and cognitive decline affecting their ability to ambulate and adhere to exercise guidelines. Diets or exercise causing weight loss are stressful and trigger numerous redundant counter regulatory mechanisms defending lean body mass, explaining failures to sustain these behaviors. In this hypothesis generating pilot study we used a NASA-developed weight supporting lower-body positive pressure (LBPP) treadmill providing comfortable low-amount, low intensity walking, challenging current exercise guidelines.  Methods: Sixteen nondiabetic, untrained, Black volunteer women (BMI 28-50), age 18-56 years were studied by anthropometry, analyses of energy expenditure and blood chemistry: oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) with insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1 and FFA and fasting lipids, cytokines, adipokines and appetitive peptides, before and after 10 weeks of twice weekly 30-minute weight supported LBPP treadmill sessions.  Results: We found novel baseline associations between gluco- and neuro-regulatory peptides and plasma lipids, inflammatory cytokines and appetitive hormones related to neurogenesis, mood and energy balance. Post-study, independent of body weight or energy expended there were significant decreases in OGTT plasma insulin (p=0.002) and GLP-1 (p=0.060) and fasting triglycerides (p=0.029), ghrelin (p=0.008) and changes in most molecules including increased leptin and beta-endorphin. Correlations between changes among different classes of peptides were highly significant, notably leptin and adiponectin, and beta-endorphin and oxytocin and orexin A. We propose synergy between low-amount, low-intensity exercise at levels below thresholds of increased sympathetic tone, and baro-physiological effects of LBPP normalizing parasympathetic tone.  Conclusion: Brief, low-dose, lower-body positive-pressure weight-supported treadmill exercise improved cardiometabolic fitness and exhibited favorable changes in neuro-regulatory peptides without weight loss in inner-city obese Black women."},

Theory predicts that evolution in complex environments should select for modular genetic architectures with limited pleiotropy among modules. However, limited data exist to test this hypothesis because the field lacks consensus for how to control for intercorrelated climate variables. We aim to characterize the genetic architecture of adaptation to climate, including the modularity of the architecture (number of distinct climate factors), overlap among modules, and physical linkage among loci. We introduce a co-association network analysis, which parses loci into groups based on differing environmental associations, and use it to study the genetic architecture of local adaptation to climate in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). We identified several non-overlapping modules of genes associated with environmental factors (aridity, freezing, geography), which supports the hypothesis of modular environmental pleiotropy. Notably, we found moderate physical linkage among some candidate loci in different modules, which may facilitate or hinder adaptation depending on the multivariate trajectory of climate change. Moreover, we show that associations with environmental principal components would have missed candidates and resulted in a limited interpretation regarding the selective environment. Finally, simulations revealed that the propensity of co-association modules to arise under neutrality increased with demographic complexity, but also that true causal loci are more highly-connected within the module, which may be useful for prioritizing candidates."},

Their origin, biological roles, and relationship to naive and foreign antigen-experienced memory T cells are incompletely understood. By analyzing TCR repertoires and using retrogenic monoclonal T-cell populations, we show that virtual memory T cells originate exclusively from strongly self-reactive T cells. Moreover, we show that the stoichiometry of the CD8 interaction with Lck regulates the size of the virtual memory T-cell compartment via modulating the self-reactivity of individual T-cell clones. We propose a so far unappreciated peripheral T-cell fate decision checkpoint that eventually leads to the differentiation of highly self-reactive T cells into virtual memory T cells. This underlines the importance of the variable level of self-reactivity in polyclonal T cells for the generation of functional T-cell diversity. Although virtual memory T cells descend from the highly self-reactive clones and acquire a partial memory program, they do not show higher capacity to induce autoimmune diabetes than naive T cells. Thus, virtual memory T cells are not generally more responsive than naive T cells, because their activity highly depends on the immunological context."},

Polo is composed of an N-term kinase domain (KD) and a C-term Polo-Box Domain (PBD), which regulates its subcellular localizations. The PBD and KD can interact and inhibit each other, and this reciprocal inhibition is relieved when Polo is phosphorylated at its activation loop. How Polo activation and localization are coupled during mitotic entry is unknown. Here we report that PBD binding to the KD masks a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Activating phosphorylation of the KD leads to exposure of the NLS and entry of Polo into the nucleus before nuclear envelope breakdown. Failures of this mechanism result in misregulation of the Cdk1-activating Cdc25 phosphatase and lead to mitotic and developmental defects in Drosophila. These results uncover novel spatiotemporal mechanisms linking master regulatory enzymes during mitotic entry."},

Here we present an integrated multiscale model, beginning with a computational neural model of the thalamus and cortex during stage N2 non-REM sleep. This network model generated sleep spindles due to the interactions of local and distant network connections and intrinsic currents within thalamocortical circuits, as specified based on the previous experiments and computational works. The core spindle activity, generated by interaction of thalamic relay and reticular neurons was projected to the cortex. The 32,652 cortical neurons were mapped onto the cortical surface reconstructed from a subject's MRI, and they were interconnected based on cortical geodesic distances. MRI was used to specify a boundary element model of the subject's brain, CSF, skull and scalp. The model generated cortical activity during spindles was then projected to the MEG and EEG sensors. Dipole strength was based on multi-microelectrode laminar recordings in humans. The resulting simulated spindles were found to be similar in amplitude and topography to those actually recorded in the same subject. This similarity of the modeled and empirical spindles was subject-specific. We found that spindles modeled as originating in core thalamocortical systems were more similar to spindles recorded with MEG than EEG, and conversely, modeled matrix spindles were more similar to recorded EEG than MEG spindles. This multiscale model provides a platform for the principled quantitative integration of existing information relevant to the generation of sleep spindles, and allows the implications of future findings to be explored. It provides a proof of principle for a methodological framework allowing large-scale integrative brain oscillations to be understood in terms of their underlying channels and synapses."},

The vast majority of disease cases appear to be caused by a combination of genetic mutations and environmental factors. We screened for genes protecting Caenorhabditis elegans dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress induced by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and identified the transthyretin-related gene ttr-33. The only described C. elegans transthyretin-related protein to date, TTR-52, has been shown to mediate corpse engulfment as well as axon repair. We demonstrate that TTR-52 and TTR-33 have distinct roles. TTR-33 is likely produced in the posterior arcade cells in the head of C. elegans larvae and is predicted to be a secreted protein. TTR-33 protects C. elegans from oxidative stress induced by paraquat or H2O2 at an organismal level. The increased oxidative stress sensitivity of ttr-33 mutants is alleviated by mutations affecting the KGB-1 MAPK kinase pathway, whereas it is enhanced by mutation of the JNK-1 MAPK kinase. Finally, we provide genetic evidence that the C. elegans cell corpse engulfment pathway is required for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons after exposure to 6-OHDA. In summary, we describe a new neuroprotective mechanism and demonstrate that TTR-33 normally functions to protect dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress-induced degeneration, potentially by acting as a secreted sensor or scavenger of oxidative stress."},

Treatment of these diseases relies on the intervention in inflammatory responses thereby restoring immune homeostasis. One cytokine that has the potential to restore immune homeostasis is the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). But until now IL-10 treatment has not been as successful as anticipated. A reason for this may be that IL-10 responsiveness depends on the environment of the inflamed tissue. In this study we describe that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a key cytokine that negatively regulates IL-10-mediated responses. Dendritic cells differentiated from bone marrow with GM- CSF have a reduced ability to respond to IL-10. Dendritic cells are impaired in their up-regulation of IL-10-induced SOCS3 expression and are unable to suppress LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 expression at an early time point. Furthermore, GM-CSF treatment partially replicates this phenotype in macrophages. Surprisingly, GM-CSF seems to regulate IL-10 activity in macrophages without affecting STAT3 activation. Still, GM-CSF induces constitutive phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2, a signalling component downstream of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Knowledge on the exact mechanism by which GM-CSF negatively regulates IL-10 activity could give novel insights on the integration of signal transduction pathways elicited by different cytokines. Ultimately this knowledge could provide us with new therapeutic strategies to treat inflammatory disorders."},

This proposal is supported by an overlap of the functional brain activations associated with the two types of tasks and by high correlations between inter-individual differences in performance. We replicated these findings in fifty-three older subjects but also showed that solving reasoning and working memory problems favors different modes of large-scale neurodynamics and that this dissimilarity increases with higher difficulty load. Specifically, superior performance in a typical working memory paradigm (n-back) was associated with up-regulation of modularity (increased between-network segregation), whereas performance in the reasoning task was associated with effective down-regulation of modularity. We also showed that working memory training promotes task-invariant increases in modularity. Since superior reasoning performance is associated with down-regulation of modular dynamics, training may thus have fostered an inefficient way of solving the reasoning tasks. This could help explain why working memory training does little to promote complex reasoning performance. The study concludes that complex reasoning abilities cannot be reduced to working memory and suggests the need to reconsider the feasibility of using working memory training interventions to attempt to achieve effects that transfer to broader cognition."},

An outbreak of C. auris occurred in a specialised cardiothoracic London hospital between April 2015 and November 2016, which to date has been the largest outbreak reported worldwide, involving a total of 72 patients.\nMethods: To understand the epidemiology of C. auris infection within this hospital, we sequenced the genomes of outbreak isolates using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina in order to type antifungal resistance alleles and to explore the outbreak within its local and global context.\nFindings: Phylogenomic analysis placed the UK outbreak in the India/Pakistan clade, demonstrating an Asian origin. The outbreak showed similar diversity to that of the entire clade and limited local spatiotemporal clustering was observed. One isolate displayed resistance to both echinocandins and 5-flucytosine; the former was associated with a serine to tyrosine amino acid substitution in the gene FKS1, and the latter was associated with a phenylalanine to isoleucine substitution in the gene FUR1. These mutations are novel for this pathogen.\nInterpretation: Multiple differential episodic selection of antifungal resistant genotypes has occurred within a genetically heterogenous population across this outbreak, creating a resilient pathogen and making it difficult to define local-scale patterns of transmission as well as implementing outbreak control measures.\nFunding: Antimicrobial Research Collaborative, Imperial College London"},

Besides the 'driver mutations' that cause the disease, cells also accumulate a number of other mutations with seemingly no direct role in this evolutionary process. They are called passenger mutations. While it has been argued that passenger mutations render tumors more fragile due to reduced fitness, the role of passenger mutations remains understudied. Using evolutionary computational models, we demonstrate that in the context of tumor suppressor gene inactivation (and hence fitness valley crossing), the presence of passenger mutations can accelerate the rate of evolution by reducing overall population fitness and increasing the relative fitness of intermediate mutants in the fitness valley crossing pathway. Hence, the baseline rate of tumor suppressor gene inactivation might be faster than previously thought. Conceptually, parallels are found in the field of turbulence and pattern formation, where instabilities can be driven by perturbations that are damped (disadvantageous), but provide a richer set of pathways such that a system can achieve some desired goal more readily. This highlights, through a number of novel parallels, the relevance of physical sciences in oncology."},

However, information on vocal output, a central component of investment in signaling, is lacking for most species employing acoustic communication. Because this lack of information is partly due to logistical and methodological difficulties in monitoring animal signaling over time, developing new approaches to quantify vocal output is of special importance. We asked whether the number of recordings of avian vocalizations in sound archives and the times when such recordings were obtained reflect estimates of vocal output and temporal patterns of vocal activity obtained through systematic monitoring of wild bird populations in tropical forest sites. Based on a sample of 43 montane forest species, we found significant relationships between the number of recordings of species detected through continuous monitoring over several months and the number of recordings archived in sound collections, especially when accounting for the area of distribution of each species. In addition, daily activity patterns based on data collected through continuous monitoring over several days did not differ from those based on recordings archived in sound collections in 12 of 15 species of lowland forest birds. Annual patterns in vocal activity of two species estimated based on recordings in collections closely resembled previously published patterns. We conclude that recordings in sound collections contain valuable yet previously unappreciated information about the vocal output and temporal patterns in vocal activity of birds. This opens the possibility of using sound collections to assess vocal output and to consider it as a variable of interest in studies on the ecology and evolution of birds and other animals that use acoustic signals for communication.We encourage field workers to keep the ears wide open, and the recorders wide ready to record."},

We observed an unexpected biphasic involvement of vmPFC during retrieval, rising and falling around an initial peak of 8-12 months, before re-engaging for older two and five year old memories. Remarkably, when re-examined eight months later, representations of individual memories had undergone their hypothesised strengthening or weakening over time.

Phylogenetic and positive selection analyses found that the six Smc5/6 subunits have been highly conserved in primates with only Smc6 showing signatures of potential virus-host 'arms-race'. Despite substantial sequence divergence, HBx proteins from hepatitis viruses naturally infecting bats, rodents, or primates efficiently degraded Smc5/6 in various species cells and rescued the replication of an HBx-deficient HBV in primary human hepatocytes. These findings point to an evolutionary-conserved antagonism of Smc5/6 by HBx.

We show that genetic mutations that present with similar phenotypes mostly affect genes that are expressed in a single unique differentiated cell type. On the other hand, we found unexpected cell plasticity of epithelial cells in the final segment of the kidney (collecting duct) that is responsible for final composition of the urine. Using computational cell trajectory analysis and in vivo linage tracing, we found that, intercalated cells (that secrete protons) and principal cells (that maintain salt, water and potassium balance) undergo a Notch mediated interconversion via a newly identified transitional cell type. In disease states this transition is shifted towards the principal cell fate. Loss of intercalated cells likely contributes to metabolic acidosis observed in kidney disease. In summary, single cell analysis advanced a mechanistic description of kidney diseases by identifying a defective homeostatic cell lineage."},

However, how actions influence memory formation remains poorly understood. Goal-directed movement engages the locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of noradrenaline in the brain. Noradrenaline is also known to enhance episodic encoding, suggesting that action could improve memory via LC engagement. Here we demonstrate, across seven experiments, that action (Go-response) enhances episodic encoding for stimuli unrelated to the action itself, compared to action inhibition (NoGo). Supporting a noradrenergic mechanism underlying this enhancement, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and pupil diameter as a proxy measure for LC-noradrenaline transmission, indicate increased encoding-related LC activity during action. A final experiment confirmed a novel prediction derived from these data that emotionally aversive stimuli, which recruit the noradrenergic system, modulate the mnemonic advantage conferred by Go-responses relative to neutral stimuli. We therefore provide converging evidence that action boosts episodic memory encoding via a noradrenergic mechanism."},

Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a two-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over three years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95% CI, 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (95% CI, 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation."},

We introduce the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine to learn the spatiotemporal structure of the population activity, and use this model to define a distance between spike trains. We show that this metric outperforms existing neural distances at discriminating pairs of stimuli that are barely distinguishable.

The regular diet group maintained a diet closely resembling self-reported regular diets. The Soylent diet group underwent three dietary phases: A) a regular diet for 2 days, B) a Soylent-only diet (five servings of Soylent daily and water as needed) for 4 days, and C) a regular diet for 4 days. Daily logs self-reporting diet, Bristol stool ratings, and any abdominal discomfort were electronically submitted. Eight fecal samples per participant were collected using fecal sampling kits, which were subsequently sent to uBiome, Inc. for sample processing and V4 16S rDNA sequencing. Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and taxonomically identified against the GreenGenes 16S database. We find that an individual\u2032s alpha-diversity is not significantly altered during a Soylent-only diet. In addition, principal coordinate analysis using the unweighted UniFrac distance metric shows samples cluster strongly by individual and not by dietary phase. Among Soylent dieters, we find a significant increase in the ratio of "},

How should we test the hypothesis that two or more brain maps are partially convergent or overlap to a significant extent? This \"correspondence problem\" affects, for example, the interpretation of comparisons between task-based patterns of functional activation, resting-state networks or modules, and neuroanatomical landmarks. In published work, this problem has been addressed with remarkable variability in terms of methodological approaches and statistical rigor. In this paper, we address the correspondence problem using a spatial permutation framework to generate null models of overlap, by applying random rotations to spherical representations of the cortical surface. We use this approach to derive clusters of cognitive functions that are significantly similar in terms of their functional neuroatomical substrates. In addition, using publicly available data, we formally demonstrate the correspondence between maps of task-based functional activity, resting-state fMRI networks and gyral-based anatomical landmarks. We provide open-access code to implement the methods presented for two commonly-used tools for surface based cortical analysis. This spatial permutation approach constitutes a useful advance over widely-used methods for the comparison of cortical maps, and thereby opens up new possibilities for the integration of diverse neuroimaging data."},

Its misfolding and subsequent aggregation into intracellular inclusions are the pathological hallmark of these diseases and may also play a central role in the molecular cascade leading to neurodegeneration. In this work, we report the existence of a novel soluble \u03b1-helical conformer of \u03b1Syn, an archetypal intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), obtained through transient interaction with lipid interfaces. We describe how the stability of this conformer is highly dependent on the continuous, dynamic oligomerization of the folded species. The conformational space of \u03b1Syn appears to be highly context-dependent, and lipid bilayers might play crucial roles as molecular chaperones for cytosolic species in a cellular environment, as they do in the case of this previously unreported structure."},

While immediate control of bacterial pathogens is typically attributed to innate defense mechanisms, whether HIV-mediated modulation of innate mechanisms like autophagy promote opportunistic infections, remains obscure. Using U1.1 and U937 macrophages, we show, HIV activation or infection inhibits autophagy and helps survival of pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-pathogenic non-tuberculous mycobacterial strains (NTMs) like Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium fortuitum. HIV achieves this by blocking xenophagy flux, which could be reversed by the autophagy inducer trehalose that kills intracellular Mtb and NTMs. We found trehalose acts as a PI (3,5) P2 agonist and activates TRPML1 to induce autophagy. Remarkably, trehalose treatment significantly reduced p24 levels in PBMCs infected with clinical HIV strains and in PBMCs derived from treatment-naive HIV patients. Taken together, our study highlights the immense potential of autophagy modulators in the therapeutic intervention of HIV and associated opportunistic infection."},

Using surface electromyography we investigated whether this difference is due to dimorphism in the conduction velocity (MNCV) of the associated alpha-motor neurons.\nMethods. Extracellular linear electrode arrays measured vastus lateralis (VL) motor unit action potential activity (MUAP). MNCV was determined from the relationship between the latency of MUAP initiation and VL distance during a PR. \nResults. In females, the PR premotor latency occurred 2.1\u00b1 0.3 ms earlier than in males and recruited alpha-motor neurons with a MNCV 5 m s-1 faster (p<0.02) than males: 52.4\u00b11.5 5 m s-1 (n=40) compared to 47.6\u00b11.3 5 m s-1 (n=41) respectively. \nConclusions In males the longer PR premotor latency was accounted for by their slower MNCV. Our finding is contrary to the observations of larger diameter alpha-motor axons and somas seen in males. Since the PR yields MNCVs values at the lower end of published values supports the size-principle of motor unit recruitment with a physiological stimulus. \nSignificance  Our findings evidence  gender dimorphism in a routine neurophysiologic test which suggest androgen modulation of skeletal muscle innervation."},

Little is known about the genetic basis underlying these changes. In this study, 215 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between a cultivated and a wild cowpea accession were used to evaluate nine domestication-related traits (pod shattering, peduncle length, flower color, flowering time, 100-seed weight, pod length, leaf length, leaf width and seed number per pod). A high-density genetic map containing 17,739 single nucleotide polymorphisms was constructed and used to identify 16 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these nine domestication-related traits. Candidate genes underlying each of those 16 QTL were identified.\nFour regions with clusters of QTL were identified, including one on chromosome 8 related to increased organ size. This study provides new knowledge of the genomic regions controlling domestication-related traits in cowpea as well as candidate genes underlying those QTL.

Echinacea products are among the top selling herbal products in Europe and the United States with indications for broad range of ailments. Purpose: This study approached the need for a novel analytical strategy in authentication of herbal products. Methods: A combination of high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and DNA metabarcoding was employed. Fifty-three Echinacea herbal products marketed across Europe were tested to evaluate the accuracy of these methods in plant identification and their potential in detecting substitutes, adulterants and other unreported plant constituents. Results: HPTLC provides a high resolution in detecting Echinacea phytochemical target compounds, but does not offer information on the other species within the product. Alternatively, we showed that the limitation of HPTLC to detect non-targeted species can be overcome through the complementary use of DNA metabarcoding. Using DNA metabarcoding, Echinacea species were detected in 34 out of the 38 retained products (89 %), but with a lack of discriminatory resolution at the species level due to the low level of molecular divergence within the Echinacea genus. All herbal products showed considerable discrepancies between ingredients listed on the label and the ones detected using DNA metabarcoding registering an overall ingredient fidelity of 43 %. Conclusion: The results confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used to test for the presence of Echinacea and simultaneously to detect other species present in even highly processed and multi-ingredient herbal products."},

We characterize the hDRG transcriptional profile in terms of tissue-restricted gene co-expression patterns and putative transcriptional regulators, and formulate an information-theoretic framework to quantify DRG enrichment. Our analyses reveal an hDRG-enriched protein-coding gene set (~140), some of which have not been described in the context of DRG or pain signaling. A majority of these show conserved enrichment in mDRG, and were mined for known drug - gene product interactions. Comparison of hDRG and tibial nerve transcriptomes suggest pervasive mRNA transport of sensory neuronal genes to axons in adult hDRG, with potential implications for mechanistic insight into chronic pain in patients. Relevant gene families and pathways were also analyzed, including transcription factors (TFs), g-protein coupled receptors (GCPRs) and ion channels.

These two tightly coordinated processes take place in less than a minute and are regulated and mediated by proteases.

In this study, we demonstrate that DPAP3 has proteolytic activity, but contrary to previously studies DPAPs, removal of its internal prodomain is not required for activation. By combining super resolution microscopy with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and immuno electron microscopy, we show that P. falciparum DPAP3 localizes to merozoite apical organelles from which it is secreted immediately before parasite egress. Using a conditional knock out approach coupled to complementation studies with wild type or mutant DPAP3, we show that DPAP3 activity is important for parasite replication and is critical for efficient RBC invasion. Finally, we demonstrate that DPAP3 does not play a significant role in parasite egress, and that the block in egress phenotype previously reported for DPAP3 inhibitors is due to off target or toxicity effects."},

A different subset of m1A exhibit a GUUCRA tRNA-like motif, are evenly distributed in the transcriptome and are dependent on the methyltransferase TRMT6/61A. Additionally, we show for the first time that m1A is prevalent in the mitochondrial-encoded transcripts. Manipulation of m1A level via TRMT61B, a mitochondria-localizing m1A methyltransferase, demonstrates that m1A in mitochondrial mRNA interferes with translation.

Therefore, we constructed a series of vectors that expedite genetic knock-in and knock-out procedures across a range of bacterial lineages. This was accomplished by developing strategies for domestication-free bacterial conjugation, designing plasmids with customizable features, and streamlining allelic exchange using visual markers of homologous recombination. These tools enabled a comparative study based on live imaging of diverse bacterial symbionts native to the zebrafish intestine, with which we discovered heterogeneous colonization patterns and a striking correlation between bacterial population biogeography and cellular behavior."},

This element is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, found in DNase-accessible regions and employs RNA polymerase 2 to activate gene expression. Through extensive analysis of several endogenous promoters, we demonstrate that this element activates bidirectional transcription through divergent start sites. Methylation of this element abrogates the associated promoter activity. When coincident with a TATA-box directional transcription remains CGCG-dependent. Because the CGCG element is sufficient to drive transcription, we propose that its unmethylated form functions as a core promoter of TATA-less CGI-associated promoters."},

In animal-pollinated species, flower shape is strongly fashioned by selection imposed by pollinators, which is expected to vary according to guilds of effective pollinators. Using the Antillean subtribe Gesneriinae (Gesneriaceae), we tested the hypothesis that pollination specialists pollinated by one functional type of pollinator have maintained more similar corolla shapes through time due to stronger selection constraints compared to species with more generalist pollination strategies. Using geometric morphometrics and evolutionary models, we showed that the corolla of hummingbird specialists, bat specialists, and species with a mixed-pollination strategy (pollinated by hummingbirds and bats; thus a more generalist strategy) have distinct shapes and that these shapes have evolved under evolutionary constraints. However, we did not find support for smaller disparity in corolla shape for hummingbird specialists compared to more generalist species. This could be because the corolla shape of more generalist species in subtribe Gesneriinae, which has evolved multiple times, is finely adapted to be effectively pollinated by both bats and hummingbirds. These results suggest that pollination generalization is not necessarily associated with relaxed selection constraints."},

To date, investigation of human cell signalling has focussed on canonical phosphorylation of serine (Ser), threonine (Thr) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues. However, mounting evidence suggests that phosphorylation of histidine also plays a central role in regulating cell biology.  Phosphoproteomics workflows rely on acidic conditions for phosphopeptide enrichment, which are incompatible with the analysis of acid-labile phosphorylation such as histidine. Consequently, the extent of non-canonical phosphorylation is likely to be under-estimated.\nWe report an Unbiased Phosphopeptide enrichment strategy based on Strong Anion Exchange (SAX) chromatography (UPAX), which permits enrichment of acid-labile phosphopeptides for characterisation by mass spectrometry.  Using this approach, we identify extensive and positional phosphorylation patterns on histidine, arginine, lysine, aspartate and glutamate in human cell extracts, including 310 phosphohistidine and >1000 phospholysine sites of protein modification.  Remarkably, the extent of phosphorylation on individual non-canonical residues vastly exceeds that of basal phosphotyrosine.

This is the case of Salmonella Typhimurium, which produces H2S by its phsABC operon. Here we show that extracellular release of H2S by S. Typhimurium is solely dependent on its phsABC operon.

Here we show that cell-cell contact can change the outcome of EGFR activation by altering its vesicular trafficking. EGFR promotes Akt-mediated vesicular recycling to maintain its plasma membrane (PM) abundance during EGF stimulation. This self-sustained vesicular recycling of EGFR generates a positive feedback that maintains PM Akt signalling and promotes migration. By decoupling EGFR activation from its vesicular recycling, Eph activity at cell-cell contacts impedes the positive feedback that maintains PM signalling and traps EGFR in endosomes. Through this change in the spatial distribution of EGFR activity, cell-cell contact selectively suppresses migratory PI3K/Akt signalling from the PM, while preserving proliferative ERK signalling from endosomes. Thus, by altering the vesicular trafficking of EGFR, the cellular environment can modulate its signalling to generate diverse outcomes to EGF stimulation."},

We find much more extensive sharing in Finns, with at least one \u2265 5 cM tract on average between pairs of unrelated individuals. By coupling haplotype sharing with fine-scale birth records from over 25,000 individuals, we find that while haplotype sharing broadly decays with geographical distance, there are pockets of excess haplotype sharing; individuals from northeast Finland share several-fold more of their genome in identity-by-descent (IBD) segments than individuals from southwest regions containing the major cities of Helsinki and Turku. We estimate recent effective population size changes over time across regions of Finland and find significant differences between the Early and Late Settlement Regions as expected; however, our results indicate more continuous gene flow than previously indicated as Finns migrated towards the northernmost Lapland region.

To identify molecular components of the aster-based inhibitory signal, we developed a means to monitor the removal of contractile ring proteins from the polar cortex after anaphase onset. Using this assay, we show that polar clearing is an active process that requires activation of Aurora A kinase by TPXL-1. TPXL-1 concentrates on astral microtubules coincident with polar clearing in anaphase, and its ability to recruit Aurora A and activate its kinase activity are essential for clearing. In summary, our data identify Aurora A kinase as an aster-based inhibitory signal that restricts contractile ring components to the cell equator during cytokinesis."},

Somatic recombination of chromosomal DNA in T cells creates a vast repertoire of structurally divergent T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize an array of non-self proteins. It also generates a genomic signature by which TCR sequences can be distinguished from other cell types in non-targeted NGS genomic data. Here we leverage this signature to extract reads with rearranged TCR sequences from a non-targeted population, such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) datasets. We isolate and confirm T cell rearranged reads from the remainder of the genome (99.9%), accurately estimate relative T cell abundance within a cellular population, and provide a snapshot of the T cell receptor repertoire. This approach is unique from available TCR software options that focus on examining the overall diversity of the TCR repertoire and require prior amplification or selection of this region before sequencing, and has particular utility in immunoscoring clinical patient samples in situations where genomic data exists and other approaches are unavailable."},

In addition to G1 cell cycle arrest, palbociclib treatment results in cell senescence, a phenotype that are not readily explained by CDK4/6 inhibition. In order to identify a molecular mechanism responsible for palbociclib-induced senescence, we performed thermal proteome profiling of MCF7 breast cancer cells. In addition to affecting known CDK4/6 targets, palbociclib induces a thermal stabilization of the 20S proteasome, despite not directly binding to it. We further show that palbociclib treatment increases proteasome activity independently of the ubiquitin pathway. This leads to cellular senescence which can be counteracted by proteasome inhibitors. Palbociclib-induced proteasome activation and senescence is mediated by reduced proteasomal association of ECM29. Loss of ECM29 activates the proteasome, blocks cell proliferation and induces senescence.

We tested every gene for an excess of damaging homozygous or compound heterozygous genotypes, and found that known recessive genes showed a significant tendency towards having lower p-values (Kolmogorov-Smirnov p=3.3E-6). Three genes passed stringent Bonferroni correction, including a new disease gene, EIF3F, and KDM5B, which has previously been reported as a dominant disease gene. KDM5B appears to follow  a complex mode of inheritance, in which heterozygous loss-of-function variants (LoFs) show incomplete penetrance and biallelic LoFs are fully penetrant. Our results suggest that a large proportion of undiagnosed developmental disorders remain to be explained by other factors, such as noncoding variants and polygenic risk."},

Davies", "Dick R. Nassel"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/164178 ", "abstract": "Multiple neuropeptides are known to regulate water and ion balance in Drosophila melanogaster. Several of these peptides also have other functions in physiology and behavior. Examples are corticotropin-releasing factor-like diuretic hormone (diuretic hormone 44; DH44) and leucokinin (LK), both of which induce fluid secretion by Malpighian tubules (MTs), but also regulate stress responses, feeding, circadian activity and other behaviors. Here, we investigated the functional relations between the LK and DH44 signaling systems. DH44 and LK peptides were only colocalized in a set of abdominal neurosecretory cells (ABLKs). Targeted knockdown of each of these peptides in ABLKs lead to increased resistance to desiccation, starvation and ionic stress. Food ingestion was diminished by knockdown of DH44, but not LK, and water retention was increased by LK knockdown only. Thus, the two colocalized peptides display similar systemic actions, but differ with respect to regulation of feeding and body water retention. We also demonstrated that DH44 and LK have additive effects on fluid secretion by MTs. It is likely that the colocalized peptides are coreleased from ABLKs into the circulation and act on the tubules where they target different cell types and signaling systems to regulate diuresis and stress tolerance. Additional targets seem to be specific for each of the two peptides and subserve regulation of feeding and water retention. Our data suggest that the ABLKs and hormonal actions are sufficient for many of the known DH44 and LK functions, and that the remaining neurons in the CNS play other functional roles."},

One such bias has been termed the 'push of the past', by which the length of time a clade has survived is conditioned on the rate of diversification that happened to pertain at its origin. This creates the illusion of a secular rate slow-down through time that is, rather, a reversion to the mean. Here we model the controls on the push of the past, and the effect it has on clade origination times, and show that it largely depends on underlying extinction rates. Crown group origins tend to become later and more dispersed as the size of the push of the past increases. An extra effect increasing early rates in lineages is also seen in large clades. The push of the past is an important but relatively neglected bias that affects many aspects of diversification patterns, such as diversification spikes after mass extinctions and at the origins of clades; it also influence rates of fossilisation, changes in rates of phenotypic evolution and even molecular clocks."},

However, by assembling a global survey of quantitative skin pigmentation phenotypes, we demonstrate that pigmentation is more complex than previously assumed with genetic architecture varying by latitude. We investigate polygenicity in the Khoe and the San, populations indigenous to southern Africa, who have considerably lighter skin than equatorial Africans. We demonstrate that skin pigmentation is highly heritable, but that known pigmentation loci explain only a small fraction of the variance. Rather, baseline skin pigmentation is a complex, polygenic trait in the KhoeSan. Despite this, we identify canonical and non-canonical skin pigmentation loci, including near SLC24A5, TYRP1, SMARCA2/VLDLR, and SNX13 using a genome-wide association approach complemented by targeted resequencing. By considering diverse, under-studied African populations, we show how the architecture of skin pigmentation can vary across humans subject to different local evolutionary pressures."},

Since the exact knowledge of its parameters is crucial in order to predict, for example, the efficiency of biocontrol agents, population dynamics, food web structure and subsequently biodiversity, a trustful parameter estimation is of utmost importance for scientists using this framework. Classical approaches for estimating functional response parameters lack flexibility and can often only serve as approximation for a correct parameter estimation. Moreover, they do not allow to incorporate side effects such as resource growth or background mortality. Both call for a new method to be established solving these problems. Here, we combined ordinary differential equation models (ODE models), that were numerically solved using computer simulations, with an iterative maximum likelihood fitting approach. We compared our method to classical approaches of fitting functional responses, using data both with and without additional resource growth and mortality. We found that for classical functional response models, like the often used type II and type III functional response, the established fitting methods are reliable. However, using more complex and flexible functional responses, our new established method outperforms the traditional methods. Additionally, only our method allows to analyze experiments correctly when resources experience growth or background mortality. Our method will enable researchers from different scientific fields that are measuring functional responses to estimate parameters correctly. These estimates will enable community ecologists to parameterize their models more precisely, allowing for a deeper understanding of complex ecological systems, and will increase the quality of ecological prediction models."},

Studies on Gram negative models reveal that during evolution in structured environments like biofilms, isogenic populations commonly diversify into phenotypically and genetically distinct variants. These variants can settle in alternative biofilm niches and develop new types of interactions that greatly influence population productivity. Here, we explore the evolutionary diversification of pellicle biofilms of the Gram positive, spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We discover that - similarly to other species - B. subtilis diversifies into distinct colony variants. These variants dramatically differ in biofilm formation abilities and expression of biofilm-related genes. In addition, using a quantitative approach, we reveal striking differences in surface complexity and hydrophobicity of the evolved colony types. Interestingly, one of the morphotypes completely lost the ability of independent biofilm formation and evolved to hitchhike with other morphotypes with improved biofilm forming abilities. Genome comparison suggests that major phenotypic transformations between the morphotypes can be triggered by subtle genetic differences. Our work demonstrates how positive complementarity effects and exploitative interactions intertwine during evolutionary diversification in biofilms."},

Its only species, Trichoplax adhaerens, was described in 1883. Despite the worldwide distribution of placozoans, morphological differences are lacking among isolates from different geographic areas and, consequently, no other species in this phylum has been described and accepted for more than 130 years. However, recent single-gene studies on the genetic diversity of this \u2033species\u2033 have revealed deeply divergent lineages of, as yet, undefined taxonomic ranks. Since single genes are not considered sufficient to define species, a whole nuclear genome comparison appears the most appropriate approach to determine relationships between placozoan lineages.  Such a \u2033taxogenomics\u2033 approach can help discover and diagnose potential additional species and, therefore, develop a much-needed, more robust, taxonomic framework for this phylum. To achieve this we sequenced the genome of a placozoan lineage isolated from Hong Kong (lineage H13), which is distantly related to T. adhaerens. The 87 megabase genome assembly contains 12,010 genes. Comparison to the T. adhaerens genome identified an average protein distance of 24.4% in more than 2,700 screened orthologs, similar to levels observed between the chordate classes mammals and birds. Genome rearrangements are commonplace and >25% of genes are not collinear (i.e. they are not in the same order in the two genomes).

MS Western relies upon GeLC-MS/MS and quantifies proteins by in-gel co-digestion with an isotopically labelled QconCAT protein chimera composed of concatenated proteotypic peptides. It requires no purification of the chimera and relates the molar abundance of all proteotypic peptides to a single reference protein.

To validate MS Western in an in vivo experiment, we quantified the molar content of zebrafish core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 during ten stages of early embryogenesis. Accurate quantification (CV<10%) corroborated the anticipated histones equimolar stoichiometry and revealed an unexpected trend in their total abundance."},

We trained a gated recurrent neural network (RNN) on human messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) sequences. Our model, mRNA RNN (mRNN), surpasses state-of-the-art methods at predicting protein-coding potential. To understand what mRNN learned, we probed the network and uncovered several context-sensitive codons highly predictive of coding potential.

In particular, microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (e.g., selection) and stochastic (e.g., dispersal) processes, and the relative influence of these two process types is hypothesized to alter the influence of microbial communities over biogeochemical function, which we define generically to represent any biogeochemical reaction of interest. We used an ecological simulation model to evaluate this hypothesis. We assembled receiving communities under different levels of dispersal from a source community that was assembled purely by deterministic selection. The dispersal scenarios ranged from no dispersal (i.e., selection-only) to dispersal rates high enough to overwhelm selection (i.e., homogenizing dispersal). We used an aggregate measure of community fitness to infer its biogeochemical function relative to other communities. We also used ecological null models to further link the relative influence of deterministic assembly to function. We found that increasing rates of dispersal decrease biogeochemical function by increasing the proportion of maladapted taxa in a local community. Niche breadth was also a key determinant of biogeochemical function, suggesting a tradeoff between the function of generalist and specialist species. Together, our results highlight the influence of spatial processes on biogeochemical function and indicate the need to account for such effects in models that aim to predict biogeochemical function under future environmental scenarios."},

Invadopodia are enriched for the structural proteins actin and cortactin, as well as metalloproteases such as MT1-MMP, whose function is to degrade the surrounding ECM. During metastasis, invadopodia are necessary for cancer cell intravasation and extravasation. While signaling pathways involved in the assembly and function of invadopodia are well studied, few studies address control of invadopodia dynamics and how the cell-ECM interactions contribute to this dynamics. Using time-lapse microscopy and mathematical modeling of cancer cell behavior, we found that the cells oscillate between invadopodia presence and cell stasis, which we term invadopodia state and migration state (invadopodia absence during cell translocation). Our data suggests that \u03b21-integrin-ECM interactions control the duration of each of the two states. By changing the concentration of cross-linkers in 2D and 3D cultures, we can generate ECM where 0-0.92 of total lysine residues are cross-linked. Using ECM with a range of cross-linking degrees we demonstrate that the dynamics of invadopodia-related functions have a non-linear (biphasic) relationship to ECM cross-linking. At intermediate levels of ECM cross-linking (0.39 for 2D and 0.36 for 3D), cells exhibit rapid invadopodia protrusion-retraction cycles and rapid calcium spikes, which in turn lead to more frequent MT1-MMP delivery, causing maximal invadopodia-dependent ECM degradation. Additionally, intermediate cross-linking leads to more frequent oscillations between invadopodia state and migration state. In contrast, both extremely high or low levels of cross-linking lead to slower invadopodia-related dynamics and lower ECM degradation levels. Collectively, these data suggest that small physical differences in extracellular environment non-linearly translate to differences in the dynamics of cancer cell behaviors. Understanding conditions under which invadopodia can be reduced or eliminated from the tumor microenvironment by subtle environment-targeting treatments may lead to combination therapies for preventing metastatic spread."},

Both groups exhibited low genetic diversity compared to other Thai populations, and contrasting patterns of mtDNA and NRY diversity: there was greater mtDNA diversity in the Maniq than in the Mlabri, while the converse was true for the NRY. We found basal uniparental lineages in the Maniq, namely mtDNA haplogroups M21a, R21 and M17a, and NRY haplogroup K. Overall, the Maniq are genetically similar to other negrito groups in Southeast Asia. By contrast, the Mlabri haplogroups (B5a1b1 for mtDNA and O1b1a1a1b and O1b1a1a1b1a1 for the NRY) are common lineages in Southeast Asian non-negrito groups, and overall the Mlabri are genetically similar to their linguistic relatives (Htin and Khmu) and other groups from northeastern Thailand. In agreement with previous studies of the Mlabri, our results indicate that the Malbri do not directly descend from the indigenous negritos. Instead, they likely have a recent origin (within the past 1,000 years) by an extreme founder event (involving just one maternal and two paternal lineages) from an agricultural group, most likely the Htin or a closely-related group."},

Models of evolutionary rescue could in principle be used to predict the treatment levels most likely to limit the emergence of resistance in pests or pathogens. Stress levels are known to affect both the rate of decline of the population (demographic effect) and the speed of adaptation to the stressing environment (evolutionary effect), but the latter aspect has received less attention. Here, we derive a model of evolutionary rescue that includes both effects, using Fisher's Geometric Model of adaptation. In this model, the fitness effects of mutations depend both on the genotype and environment in which they arise. In particular, the model introduces a dependence between the proportion of rescue mutants, or their cost, and the level of stress. Analytic results were obtained under a strong selection weak mutation regime, and their accuracy was tested by simulations. Stress can affect different parameters of the fitness landscape in our model, which are amenable to empirical measurements. These effects can be summarized into a single composite parameter, measuring stress intensity. Using this composite parameter, we describe a narrow \u201ccharacteristic stress window\u201d of stress levels, over which the rescue probability drops from very likely to very unlikely.  The rescue probability drops more sharply with increasing stress than in previous models without context-dependent mutation.

Current industrial processing standards involve chemical extraction with a yield of 1-4 mg per kilo of fruit. As such its market price can fluctuate up to $20,000 per kg. Metabolic engineering approaches to synthesise this molecule by microbial fermentation have only resulted in low yields of up to 5 mg L-1. In contrast, cell-free synthetic biochemistry offers an intriguing compromise to the engineering constraints provided by the living cell. Using purified enzymes or a two-step semi-synthetic route, an optimised pathway was formed for raspberry ketone synthesis leading up to 100% yield conversion. The semi-synthetic route is potentially scalable and cost-efficient for industrial synthesis of raspberry ketone."},

A lot has been explained from the translational viewpoint for the observed phenomenon. To understand codon usage bias from the transcriptional perspective, we present here a holistic picture of this phenomenon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using both wild type and computationally mutated mRNAs. Although in wild type, both codon usage bias and mRNA stability positively regulate the gene (mRNA) expression level and are positively correlated with each other, any deviation from natural situation breaks such equilibrium. Computational examination of mRNA sequences with different sets of synonymous codon composition reveals that in mutated condition, the mRNA expression becomes reduced. Furthermore, constraining codon usage pattern to wild type and carrying out randomization of codons resulted in less stable mRNA. Further, we realized a Boolean Expression explaining the gene expression under various conditions of bias and mRNA stability. These studies suggest that selection of codons is favored for regulation of gene expression through potential formation of messenger RNA structures which contribute to folding stability. The naturally occurring codon composition is responsible for optimization of gene expression, and under such composition, the mRNA structure having highest stability is selected by nature."},

Engineering the spatial organization of biochemistry has emerged as a key theme of synthetic biology, with numerous technologies promising improved biosynthetic pathway performance. One strategy, however, may produce disparate results for different biosynthetic pathways. We propose a spatially resolved kinetic model to explore this fundamental design choice in systems and synthetic biology. We predict that two example biosynthetic pathways have distinct optimal organization strategies that vary based on pathway-dependent and cell-extrinsic factors. Moreover, we outline this design space in general as a function of kinetic and biophysical properties, as well as culture conditions. Our results suggest that organizing biosynthesis has the potential to substantially improve performance, but that choosing the appropriate strategy is key. The flexible mathematical framework we propose can be adapted to diverse biosynthetic pathways, and lays a foundation to rationally choose organization strategies for biosynthesis."},

Molecular modifications of these secretion systems may lead to the emergence of new bacterial-environment interactions, although this remains unexplored. In this study we investigate the possible link between molecular and functional changes in secretion proteins and the ecological diversity of bacteria. We studied functional modifications in secretion proteins by identifying events of functional evolutionary divergence-that is, changes at the molecular level that have driven changes of protein's function. We present data supporting that these functional diversifications occurred in essential secretion proteins in bacteria. In particular, functional divergence of the two most important secretion proteins SecA and SecY in pathogenic bacteria suggests that molecular changes at these proteins are responsible for their adaptations to the host. Functional divergence has mainly occurred at protein domains involved in ATP hydrolysis in SecA and membrane pore formation in SecY. This divergence is stronger in pathogenic bacteria for protein copies resulting from the duplication of SecA/SecY, known as SecA2/SecY2. In concert with these results, we find that the secretome of bacteria with the strongest functional divergence is enriched for proteins specialized in the interaction with specific environments. We unravel evolutionary signatures that link mutations at secretion proteins to the ecological diversification of bacteria."},

Crucially, the common substrate includes the Broca area, a region well known for processing structured sequences in language. These findings have several implications. First, they directly support the hypothesis that language and music share syntactic integration mechanisms. Second, they show that the Broca area is capable of operating supramodally across these two domains. Finally, these results dismiss the recent hypothesis that domain general processes or proximal neural substrates explain the previously observed overlap between neuroimaging activations across the two domains."},

Upon stimulation, they release substances stored in their granules via regulated exocytosis. In other cell types, Munc13 proteins play essential roles in regulated exocytosis. We found that MCs express Munc13-2 and -4, and we studied their roles using global and conditional knockout (KO) mice. In a model of systemic anaphylaxis, we found no difference between WT and Munc13-2 KO mice, but global and MC-specific Munc13-4 KO mice developed less hypothermia. This protection correlated with lower plasma histamine levels and histological evidence of defective MC degranulation, and not with changes in MC development, distribution, numbers or morphology. In vitro assays revealed that the defective MC response in the absence of Munc13-4 was limited to regulated exocytosis, leaving other MC secretory effector responses intact. Single cell capacitance measurements in MCs from mouse mutants with different expression levels of Munc13-4 in their MCs showed that as levels of Munc13-4 decrease, the rate of exocytosis declines first, and the total amount of exocytosis follows. A requirement for Munc13-2 in MC exocytosis was revealed only in the absence of Munc13-4. Electrophysiology and electron microscopy studies showed that the number of multigranular compound events (granule-to-granule homotypic fusion) was severely reduced in the absence of Munc13-4. We conclude that while Munc13-2 plays a minor role, Munc13-4 is essential for regulated exocytosis in MCs, and that this MC effector response is required for a full IgE-mediated anaphylactic response."},

Monitoring the levels of methyl CoM reductase subunit A (mcrA) transcripts during an acetate-injection field experiment demonstrated that acetoclastic methanogens from the genus Methanosarcina were enriched after 40 days of acetate amendment. The increased abundance of Methanosarcina corresponded with an accumulation of methane in the groundwater. An enrichment culture dominated by a Methanosarcina species with the same Methanosarcina mcrA sequence that predominated in the field experiment could effectively convert acetate to methane. In order to determine whether Methanosarcina species could be participating in U(VI) reduction in the subsurface, cell suspensions of M. barkeri were incubated in the presence of U(VI) with acetate provided as the electron donor. U(VI) was reduced by metabolically active M. barkeri cells, however, no U(VI) reduction was observed in inactive controls. These results demonstrate that Methanosarcina species could play an important role in the long-term bioremediation of uranium-contaminated aquifers after depletion of Fe(III) oxides limits the growth of Geobacter species. The results also suggest that Methanosarcina have the potential to influence uranium geochemistry in a diversity of anaerobic sedimentary environments."},

A large number of pathway-based analysis tools have been developed toward this goal. These pathways are often manually curated and thus associations are subject to the biases of the curator. A potentially attractive alternative is to define pathways based on the inherent functionality and connectivity of the network itself. Within metabolism, functionality is defined by the production and consumption of metabolites, and connectivity by metabolites participating in reactions through common enzymes. In this work, we present an algorithm, termed MetPath, that calculates pathways for production and consumption of metabolites. We show how these pathways have attractive properties, such as the ability to integrate multiple data types and weight contribution of genes within the pathway by their functional contribution to metabolite production/consumption. Pathways calculated in this manner are condition-specific and thus are custom tailored to the system of interest, in contrast to curated pathways. We find that these pathways predict gene expression correlation better compared to manually-curated pathways. Additionally, we find that these pathways can be used to understand gene expression changes between growth conditions and between cell types. This work serves to better understand the functional pathway structure underlying cell metabolism and helps to enable systems analyses of high-throughput data."},

It is often believed that the number of truly important predictors is small relative to the total number of variables, making computational approaches to variable selection and dimension reduction extremely important. To reduce dimensionality, commonly-used two-step methods first cluster the data in some way, and build models using cluster summaries to predict the phenotype. It is known that important exposure variables can alter correlation patterns between clusters of high-dimensional variables, i.e., alter network properties of the variables. However, it is not well understood whether such altered clustering is informative in prediction. Here, assuming there is a binary exposure with such network-altering effects, we explore whether use of exposure-dependent clustering relationships in dimension reduction can improve predictive modelling in a two-step framework. Hence, we propose a modelling framework called ECLUST to test this hypothesis, and evaluate its performance through extensive simulations. With ECLUST, we found improved prediction and variable selection performance compared to methods that do not consider the environment in the clustering step, or to methods that use the original data as features. We further illustrate this modelling framework through the analysis of three data sets from very different fields, each with high dimensional data, a binary exposure, and a phenotype of interest. Our method is available in the eclust CRAN package."},

The current study aimed to address the question of whether attentional state prior to encoding, as indexed by alpha oscillatory activity, modulates the consolidation of images across periods of sleep and wake. 22 participants aged 18 to 41 years (mean age = 27.3) viewed 120 emotionally valenced images (positive, negative, neutral) before a 2hr afternoon sleep opportunity and an equivalent period of wake. Following the sleep and wake conditions, participants were required to distinguish between 120 previously seen (target) images and 120 new (distractor) images. Relative alpha power (adjusted according to participants individual alpha frequency) was computed to index attentional state prior to the learning phase. Generalised linear mixed effects modelling revealed memory performance was modulated by attention, such that greater pre-encoding alpha synchronisation promoted memory consolidation after wake, but not sleep. There was no difference in memory performance between positive, negative and neutral stimuli. Modulations in alpha oscillatory activity may help coordinate the flow of information between task-relevant cortical regions and a thalamo-cortical loop that subserves the formation of memory during times of wake but not sleep."},

Survival analysis and extended Cox regression models were used to generate hazards ratios for selected predictor variables. A total of 9184 restorations were followed in 1551 unique patients. 28.7 percent of the restorations failed during the follow-up period, and overall the restorations had an average lifespan of 2.48 years. Restoration size and restorative material were associated with restoration longevity. Restorations that were not the first eligible restoration for that tooth in the database also had poorer survival than the first restoration for that tooth. In this sample of elderly outpatients attending an academic dental clinic, restoration size, material, and sequence were related to restoration longevity over a 15-year period. This information could be helpful to elderly patients who are considering various restorative treatment options as they participate in dental treatment planning and informed consent."},

In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalography (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75-95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55-125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space."},

Structural data of the SecA-SecYEG complex has provided considerable insight into mechanism behind this process. Previously, we developed a Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation, whereby the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis favours the forward movement of pre-protein [Allen, Corey, Oately et al. eLife 2016]. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of a SecA-SecYEG complex engaged with pre-protein to address how this is achieved. The results provide an explanation of the underlying mechanism of protein transport. Our data reveals considerable pre-protein secondary structure, which demonstrates a nucleotide-dependent asymmetry across the channel. The data suggests that ATP-dependent pre-protein transport is partly driven by pre-protein secondary structure formation.

However, understanding how multiple brain functions affect behavior has been difficult. In order to decipher dynamic brain functions from time-series of behavioral data, we developed a machine learning strategy that extracts distinguishing behavioral features of sensory navigation. We first investigated experience-dependent enhancement of odor avoidance behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We segmented worms' trajectories during olfactory navigation into two behavioral states, analyzed 92 features of the states, and automatically extracted 9 distinguishing features modulated by prior odor experience using a statistical index, the gain ratio. The extracted features included ones previously unidentified, one of which indicated that the prior odor experience lowers worms' behavioral responses to a small increase in odor concentration, causing enhanced odor avoidance. In fact, calcium imaging analysis revealed that the response of ASH nociceptive neurons to a small odor increase was significantly reduced after prior odor experience. In addition, based on extracted features, multiple mutant strains were categorized into several groups that are related to physiological functions of the mutated genes, suggesting a possible estimation of unknown gene function by behavioral features. Furthermore, we also extracted behavioral features modulated by experience in acoustic navigation of bats. Thus, our results demonstrate that, regardless of animal species, sensory modality, and spatio-temporal scale, behavioral features during navigation can be extracted by machine learning analysis, which may lead to the understanding of information processing in the brain."},

Since CA3 network capacity is finite, a mechanism for enhancing memory encoding during important events would ensure greater efficiency, but the salient signal that might determine this memory selectivity filter is unknown. Using experimental and computational methods we show that the cholinergic system can operate as a memory selectivity filter by combining 3 separate mechanisms: disinhibition of feed-forward mossy fiber inhibition enables synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses; Increasing cellular excitability lowers the threshold for ensemble formation; Reduction of overall CA3-CA3 recurrent synapse strength allows for an increase in overlap between ensembles. Thus, we show that acetylcholine release enables the selective encoding of salient high-density episodic memories in the hippocampus."},

By leveraging single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of LIN28 binding sites in vivo, we determined that the CSD recognizes a (U)GAU motif. This motif partitions the let-7 family into Class I precursors with both CSD and ZKD binding sites and Class II precursors with ZKD but no CSD binding sites. LIN28 in vivo recognition, and subsequent 3\u2032 uridylation and degradation, of Class I precursors is more efficient, leading to their stronger suppression in LIN28-activated cells and cancers.

Both the localization and the dynamic behavior of Ki-67 on mitotic chromosomes were not largely affected upon depletion of condensin subunits, and vice versa. When both Ki-67 and SMC2 (a core subunit of condensins) were depleted, ball-like chromosome clusters with no sign of discernible thread-like structures were observed. This severe defective phenotype was distinct from that observed in cells depleted of either Ki-67 or SMC2 alone. Our results show that Ki-67 and condensins, which localize to the external surface and the central axis of mitotic chromosomes, respectively, have independent yet cooperative functions in supporting the structural integrity of mitotic chromosomes."},

Many studies have employed gene knockout collections or gene disruption/depletion strategies to identify routes for evolving resistance to chemical agents. By contrast, searching for point-mutational genetic suppressors that can identify separation- or gain-of-function mutations, has been limited even in simpler, genetically amenable organisms such as yeast, and has not until recently been possible in mammalian cell culture systems. Here, by demonstrating its utility in identifying suppressors of cellular sensitivity to the drugs camptothecin or olaparib, we describe an approach allowing systematic, large-scale detection of spontaneous or chemically-induced suppressor mutations in yeast and in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells in a short timeframe, and with potential applications in essentially any other haploid system. In addition to its utility for molecular biology research, this protocol can be used to identify drug targets and to predict mechanisms leading to drug resistance. Mapping suppressor mutations on the primary sequence or three-dimensional structures of protein suppressor hits provides insights into functionally relevant protein domains, advancing our molecular understanding of protein functions, and potentially helping to improve drug design and applicability."},

We present two structures of the human pancreatic KATP channel, containing the ABC transporter SUR1 and the inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir6.2, in the presence of Mg2+ and nucleotides. These structures, referred to as quatrefoil and propeller forms, were determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.9 \u00c5 and 5.6 \u00c5, respectively. In both forms ATP occupies the inhibitory site in Kir6.2. The nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 are dimerized with Mg2+-ATP in the degenerate site and Mg2+-ADP in the consensus site. A lasso extension forms an interface between SUR1 and Kir6.2 adjacent to the ATP site in the propeller form, and is disrupted in the quatrefoil form. These structures support the role of SUR1 as an ADP sensor and highlight the lasso extension as a key regulatory element in ADPs ability to override ATP inhibition."},

In this study, we characterized single-cell transcriptional profiles of the murine non-myocyte cardiac cellular landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Detailed molecular analyses revealed the diversity of the cardiac cellulome and facilitated the development of novel techniques to isolate understudied cardiac cell populations such as mural cells and glia.

Here we evaluate the role of anthropogenic drivers in marine ecosystems as drivers of change in local species richness with a meta-analysis of a novel dataset of temporal change in species richness. We paired biodiversity data from 144 sites with large-scale drivers derived from geospatial databases: human cumulative impact scores, sea surface temperature change, nutrient loading, and invasion potential. Three specific drivers (nutrient inputs, rate of linear temperature change, and non-native species invasion potential) explained patterns in local marine species richness change. We show that these drivers have opposing effects on biodiversity trends. In some cases, variability in drivers can create contrasting directions of change yielding observations of no net change when localities are pooled in an attempt to find a global average. Further, long-term studies reveal different effects of drivers that are not observed in short-term studies. These findings begin to explain high variability observed in species diversity trends at local scales. Formally attributing local species diversity change to human drivers is essential to understanding global patterns of local species diversity change and their consequences."},

Understanding Ebola Virus (EBOV) virulence evolution is not only timely but also raises specific questions because it causes one of the most virulent human infections and it is capable of transmission after the death of its host. Using a compartmental epidemiological model that captures three transmission routes (by regular contact, via dead bodies and by sexual contact), we infer the evolutionary dynamics of case fatality ratio (CFR) on the scale of an outbreak and on the long term. Our major finding is that the virus's specific life cycle imposes selection for high levels of virulence and that this pattern is robust to parameter variations in biological ranges. In addition to shedding a new light on the ultimate causes of EBOV's high virulence, these results generate testable predictions and contribute to informing public health policies. In particular, burial management stands out as the most appropriate intervention since it decreases the R0 of the epidemics, while imposing selection for less virulent strains."},

Prey DNA detection success is known to be affected by multiple factors, however the type of dietary sample has rarely been considered. Here, we address this knowledge gap by comparing prey DNA detection success from three types of dietary samples. In a controlled feeding experiment, using the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius as a model predator, we collected regurgitates, feces and whole consumers (including their gut contents) at different time points post-feeding. All dietary samples were analyzed using multiplex PCR targeting three different length DNA fragments (128 bp, 332 bp and 612 bp). Our results show that both the type of dietary sample and the size of the DNA fragment contribute to a significant part of the variation found in the detectability of prey DNA. Specifically, we observed that in both regurgitates and whole consumers prey DNA was detectable significantly longer for all fragment sizes than for feces. Based on these observations, we conclude that prey DNA detected from regurgitates and whole consumers DNA extracts are comparable, whereas prey DNA detected from feces, though still sufficiently reliable for ecological studies, will not be directly comparable to the former. Therefore, regurgitates and feces constitute an interesting, non-lethal source for dietary information that could be applied to field studies in situations when invertebrate predators should not be killed."},

One of these regularities is the relative position of objects in a scene (e.g., a sofa in front of a television), with behavioral research showing that regularly positioned objects are easier to perceive and to remember. Here we use fMRI to test how positional regularities are encoded in the visual system. Participants viewed pairs of objects that formed minimalistic two-object scenes (e.g., a \"living room\" consisting of a sofa and television) presented in their regularly experienced spatial arrangement or in an irregular arrangement (with interchanged positions). Additionally, single objects were presented centrally and in isolation. Multi-voxel activity patterns evoked by the object pairs were modeled as the average of the response patterns evoked by the two single objects forming the pair. In two experiments, this approximation in object-selective cortex was significantly less accurate for the regularly than the irregularly positioned pairs, indicating integration of individual object representations. More detailed analysis revealed a transition from independent to integrative coding along the posterior-anterior axis of the visual cortex, with the independent component (but not the integrative component) being almost perfectly predicted by object selectivity across the visual hierarchy. These results reveal a transitional stage between individual object and multi-object coding in visual cortex, providing a possible neural correlate of efficient processing of regularly positioned objects in natural scenes."},

We aimed at unraveling the roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in the complex immune signaling network controlling the establishment of tolerant response of potato cv. Desiree to the virus. We constructed a sRNA regulatory network connecting sRNAs and their targets to link sRNA level responses to physiological processes. We discovered an interesting novel sRNAs-gibberellin regulatory circuit being activated as early as 3 days post inoculation before viral multiplication can be detected. Increased levels of miR167 and phasiRNA931 were reflected in decreased levels of transcripts involved in gibberellin biosynthesis. Moreover, decreased concentration of gibberellin confirmed this regulation. The functional relation between lower activity of gibberellin signaling and reduced disease severity was previously confirmed in Arabidopsis-virus interaction using knockout mutants. We further showed that this regulation is salicylic acid-dependent as the response of sRNA network was attenuated in salicylic acid-depleted transgenic counterpart NahG-Desiree expressing severe disease symptoms. Besides downregulation of gibberellin signaling, regulation of several other parts of sRNA network in tolerant Desiree revealed similarities to responses observed in mutualistic symbiotic interactions. The intertwining of different regulatory networks revealed shows how developmental signaling, disease symptom development and stress signaling can be balanced."},

Hvidsten"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/151431 ", "abstract": "Background: Understanding how complex traits evolve through adaptive changes in gene regulation remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Over the last ~50 million years, Earth has experienced climate cooling and ancestrally tropical plants have adapted to expanding temperate environments. The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass flora of the temperate regions, but conserved cold-response genes that might have played a role in the cold adaptation to temperate climate remain unidentified.\nResults: To establish if molecular responses to cold are conserved throughout the Pooideae phylogeny, we assembled the transcriptomes of five species spanning early to later diverging lineages, and compared short- and long-term cold response in orthologous genes based on gene expression data. We confirmed that most genes previously identified as cold responsive in barley also responded to cold in our barley experiment. Interestingly, comparing cold response across the lineages using 8633 high confidence ortholog groups revealed that nearly half of all cold responsive genes were species specific and more closely related species did not share higher numbers of cold responsive genes than more distantly related species. Also, the previously identified cold-responsive barley genes displayed low conservation of cold response across species. Nonetheless, more genes than expected by chance shared cold response, both based on previously studied genes and based on the high confidence ortholog groups. Noticeable, all five species shared short-term cold response in nine general stress genes as well as the ability to down-regulate the photosynthetic machinery during cold temperatures. \nConclusions: We observed widespread lineage specific cold response in genes with conserved sequence across the Pooideae phylogeny. This is consistent with phylogenetic dating and historic temperature data which suggest that selection pressure resulting from dramatic global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. To what degree lineage specific evolution acted primarily through gain or loss of cold response remains unclear, however, phylogeny-wide conservation of certain genes and processes indicated that the last common ancestor may have possessed some cold response."},

Over the last years, major progress has been made in identifying novel imprinted candidate genes in plants, owing to affordable next-generation sequencing technologies. However, reports on sequencing the transcriptome of hybrid F1 seed tissues strongly disagree about how many and which genes are imprinted. This raises questions about the relative impact of biological, environmental, technical, and analytic differences or biases. Here, we adopt a statistical approach, frequently used in RNA-seq data analysis, which properly models count overdispersion and considers replicate information of reciprocal crosses. We show that our statistical pipeline outperforms other methods in identifying imprinted genes in simulated and real data. Accordingly, reanalysis of genome-wide imprinting studies in Arabidopsis and maize shows that, at least for the Arabidopsis dataset, an increased agreement across datasets can be observed. For maize, however, consistent reanalysis did not yield in a larger overlap between the datasets. This suggests that the discrepancy across publications might be partially due to different analysis pipelines but that technical, biological, and environmental factors underlie much of the discrepancy between datasets. Finally, we show that the set of genes that can be characterized regarding allelic bias by all studies with minimal confidence is small (~8,000/27,416 genes for Arabidopsis and ~12,000/39,469 for maize). In conclusion, we propose to use biologically replicated reciprocal crosses, high sequence coverage, and a generalized linear model approach to identify differentially expressed alleles in developing seeds."},

In this study we have combined novel in vivo imaging of cortical microvascular and mural cell architecture with mathematical modelling of blood flow and oxygen transport, to provide new insights into CBF regulation that would be inaccessible in a conventional experimental context. Our study implicates vasomotion of smooth muscle actin-covered vessels, rather than pericyte-covered capillaries, as the main mechanism for modulating tissue oxygenation. We also resolve seemingly paradoxical observations in the literature around reduced blood velocity in response to arteriolar constrictions and deduce the cause to be propagation of constrictions to upstream penetrating arterioles. We provide support for pericytes acting as signalling conduits for upstream smooth muscle activation, and erythrocyte deformation as a complementary regulatory mechanism. Finally, we caution against the use of blood velocity as a proxy measurement for flow. Our combined imaging-modelling platform complements conventional experimentation allowing cerebrovascular physiology to be probed in unprecedented detail."},

These factors have different effects on diffusion but act simultaneously so the observed diffusion is a complex mixture of diffusive behaviors (directed, >Brownian, anomalous or confined). Therefore commonly used approaches to quantify diffusion based on averaging of the displacements, such as the mean square displacement, are not adapted to the analysis of this heterogeneity. We introduce a new parameter, the packing coefficient Pc, which gives an estimate of the degree of free movement that a molecule displays in a period of time independently of its global diffusivity. Applying this approach to two different situations (diffusion of a lipid probe and trapping of receptors at synapses), we show that Pc detected and localized temporary changes of diffusive behavior both in time and in space. More importantly, it allowed the detection of periods with very high confinement (~immobility), their frequency and duration, and thus it can be used to calculate the effective kon and koff of scaffolding interactions such those that immobilize receptors at synapses."},

Participants viewed movies depicting an actor performing activities on two fictive days in her life. Some activities were repeated across days, other activities were repeated with a changed feature (e.g., waking up to an alarm clock or a phone alarm), and a final set of activities was performed on Day 2 only. After a one-week delay, participants completed a cued recall test for the activities of Day 2. Unsurprisingly, exact repetition boosted final recall. More surprising, features that changed from Day 1 to Day 2 were remembered approximately as well as features that were only presented on Day 2, showing an absence of proactive interference and in some cases proactive facilitation. Proactive facilitation was strongly related to participants' ability to detect and recollect the changes. Younger adults detected and recollected more changes than older adults, which in part explained older adults' differential deficit in memory for changed activity features. We propose that this pattern may reflect observers' use of episodic memory to make predictions during the experience of a new activity, and that when predictions fail, this triggers processing that benefits subsequent episodic memory. Disruption of this chain of processing could play a role in age-related episodic memory deficits."},

Although each test emphasizes a certain component of cognition, a poor score can reflect many possible processing deficits. Here we explore the use of simultaneous eye tracking and EEG to decompose test performance into interpretable components of cognitive processing. We examine the specific case of Symbol Search, a processing speed subtest of the WISC, which involves searching for the presence of either of two target symbols among five search symbols.  To characterise the signatures of effective performance of the test, we asked 26 healthy adults to perform a computerized version of it while recording continuous EEG and eye-tracking. We first established basic gaze-shifting patterns in the task, such as more frequent and prolonged fixation of each target than each search symbol, and longer search symbol fixations and overall trial duration for target-absent trials. We then entered multiple such metrics into a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis, which revealed that short trial completion times were mainly predicted by longer initial fixations on the targets and fewer subsequent confirmatory saccades directed back to the targets. Further, the tendency to make confirmatory saccades was associated with stronger gamma-amplitude modulation by mid-frontal theta-phase in the EEG during initial target symbol encoding. Taken together, these findings indicate that efficient Symbol Search performance depends more on effective memory encoding than on general processing speed."},

While the role of the hippocampus in memory is studied predominantly in rodents, rodent neurological disease models have not historically translated well to human treatment. Non-human primate disease models, while highly translational, present both economic and ethical challenges. Therefore, an alternative research model is required to study memory and cognition during development and to follow disease progression. Because pig models are widely used in other translational research, they may provide an excellent compromise between rodents and non-human primates due in part to the gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition of the porcine brain. In addition, the porcine hippocampal anatomy and cytoarchitecture more closely resembles that of primates than rodents. To advance the study of the neurophysiology of the pig hippocampus and related structures, we utilized stereotaxis combined with single-unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place laminar silicon depth probes into the dorsal hippocampus of miniature pigs without the need for image guidance. We then implemented an in vivo, electrophysiology-based methodology to identify hippocampal layers and to examine hippocampal neurophysiology using these depth probes. This methodology allowed for the simultaneous recording of laminar field potentials and single-cell activity in multiple layers in the dorsal hippocampus. The laminar structure of dorsal hippocampus and the precise location of the probes were confirmed by electrophysiology and histopathology, eliminating the need to recover electrode tracks in future animals. This methodology allows us to investigate hippocampal electrophysiology under anesthesia, with potential expansion into awake behaving neurophysiology. Accessible neurophysiology of the pig hippocampus may allow for the development of new translational models of neurological disorders, with the possibility of evaluating the neuronal and circuitry disruptions that underlie cognitive and memory dysfunction."},

However, in practice, due to its (until recently) comparatively high cost, its application for the analysis of large data sets (i.e. > 50 samples) has been lagging behind other more cost-efficient platforms, such as for example the Illumina microarrays (Infinium 27K, 450k and EPIC). Subsequently, despite the variety of software tools that exist for the analysis of WGBS, processing of large datasets still remains cumbersome. We present GEMBS, a bioinformatics pipeline specifically designed for the analysis of large WGBS data sets.

The model simulates at scale a cylindrical volume with a diameter of 300 m and cortical depth 1350 m of M1. It includes over 10,000 cells distributed across cortical layers based on measured cell densities, with close to 30 million synaptic connections. Neuron models were optimized to reproduce electrophysiological properties of major classes of M1 neurons. Layer 5 corticospinal and corticostriatal neuron morphologies with 700+ compartments reproduced cell 3D reconstructions, and their ionic channel distributions were optimized within experimental constraints to reproduce in vitro recordings. The network was driven by the main long-range inputs to M1: posterior nucleus (PO) and ventrolateral (VL) thalamus PO, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1, S2), contralateral M1, secondary motor cortex (M2), and orbital cortex (OC). The network local and long-range connections depended on pre- and post-synaptic cell class and cortical depth. Data was based on optogenetic circuit mapping studies which determined that connection strengths vary within layer as a function of the neuron's cortical depth. The synaptic input distribution across cell dendritic trees -- likely to subserve important neural coding functions -- was also mapped using optogenetic methods and incorporated into the model. We employed the model to study the effect on M1 of increased activity from each of the long-range inputs, and of different levels of H-current in pyramidal tract-projecting (PT) corticospinal neurons. Microcircuit dynamics and information flow were quantified using firing rates, oscillations, and information transfer measures (Granger causality and normalized transfer entropy). Simulation results support the hypothesis that M1 operates along a continuum of modes characterized by the degree of activation of intratelencephalic (IT), corticothalamic (CT) and PT neurons. The particular subset of M1 neurons targeted by different long-range inputs and the level of H-current in PT neurons regulated the different modes. Downregulation of H-current facilitated synaptic integration of inputs and increased PT output activity. Therefore, VL, cM1 and M2 inputs with downregulated H-current promoted an PT-predominant mode; whereas PO, S1 and S2 inputs with upregulated H-current favored an IT/CT-predominant mode, but a mixed mode where upper layer IT cells in turn activated PT cells if H-current was downregulated. This evidenced two different pathways that can generate corticospinal output: motor-related inputs bypassing upper M1 layers and directly projecting to PT cells, and sensory-related inputs projecting to superficial IT neurons in turn exciting PT cells. These findings provide a hypothetical mechanism to translate action planning into action execution. Overall, our model serves as an extensible framework to combine experimental data at multiple scales and perform in silico experiments that help us understand M1 microcircuit dynamics, information flow and biophysical mechanisms, and potentially develop treatments for motor disorders."},

The treatments were individually compared to Retinol palmitate as positive control and 0.9% sterilized normal saline solution as negative control. Data were gathered and analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Least Significant Difference (LSD) to test for the significant anti-angiogenic activity and pair-wise comparison among the treatments respectively using a p-value of less than 0.01. Analysis showed that there is no significant difference between the fruit extracts and positive control while a significant difference between the fruit extracts and negative control was observed. Both treatments showed very good anti-angiogenic effect with average scores of 1.33 and 1.67 respectively compared to the positive control with a scoring averaging of 1.78.

SCA12 is one of the most prominent SCA-subtype in India and till date no appropriate disease models have been described. Our aim was to establish human iPSC derived neuronal cell lines of SCA12 and study transcriptomic level alterations induced by CAG expansion. For translational application, peripheral blood transcriptomics of SCA12 patients was also performed. Lymphoblastoid cell lines of three SCA12 patients were reprogrammed to iPSCs and then re-differentiated into pan-neuronal lineage. RNA-sequencing based comparative transcriptomics was performed for disease and control cell lineages. Microarray based transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood of SCA12 patients was performed in a case/control (n=15/9) design. We have successfully created human neuronal cell lines of SCA12 patient as exhibited by their molecular profiling. Differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data has shown enrichment for type-I interferon signaling and other relevant cellular processes in SCA12-neurons. At the splice-isoform level, we observed an upregulation of expanded CAG containing non-coding transcript of PPP2R2B. Peripheral blood transcriptomics analysis and targeted validation of RNA-Seq data has allowed us to identify inflammatory signatures as potential markers of molecular pathology in SCA12. Our study has allowed us to establish first iPSC based neuronal cell lines of SCA12. We have identified pro-inflammatory signatures in SCA12-neurons suggestive of a dsRNA mediated activation of interferon signaling and that corroborates with the emerging evidence of neuronal atrophy due to neuro-inflammation in common neurodegenerative diseases. This study involved development of an iPSCs derived neuronal cells of SCA12 and look through signatures of neurodegeneration by whole RNA sequencing. This model sheds light upon key role of RNA mediated induced response in Interferon signaling for neurodegeneration."},

Unfortunately, the correlations between different motional modes are poorly captured by discrete ensemble representations. Here, we present new ways to both represent and visualize correlated interdomain motions. Interdomain motions are determined directly from residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), represented as a continuous conformational distribution, and visualized using the disk-on-sphere (DoS) representation. Using the DoS representation, features of interdomain motions, including correlations, are intuitively visualized. The representation works especially well for multidomain systems with broad conformational distributions. We use this new paradigm to study the interdomain motions of staphylococcal protein A, which is a key virulence factor contributing to the pathogenicity of S. aureus. We capture the smooth transitions between important states and demonstrate the utility of continuous distribution functions for computing components of binding thermodynamics. Such insights allow the dissection the dynamic structural components of functionally important intermolecular interactions."},

These methods have multiple advantages over direct observations and manual data input as they reduce bias related to human perception and fatigue, and deliver more extensive and complete data sets that enhance statistical power. One major challenge that automation can overcome is the observation of many individuals at once, enabling whole-group or whole-population tracking. \n2.\tWe provide a detailed description for implementing an automated system for tracking birds. Our system uses printed, machine-readable codes mounted on backpacks. This simple, yet robust, tagging system can be used simultaneously on multiple individuals to provide data on bird identity, position and directionality. Further, because our codes and backpacks are printed on paper, they are very lightweight.\n3.\tWe describe the implementation of this automated system on two flocks of zebra finches. We test different camera options, and describe their advantages and disadvantages. We show that our method is reliable, relatively easy to implement and monitor, and with proper handling, has proved to be safe for the birds over long periods of time. Further, we highlight how using single-board computers to control the frequency and duration of image capture makes this system affordable, flexible, and adaptable to a range of study systems.\n4.\tThe ability to automate the measurement of individual positions has the potential to significantly increase the power of both observational and experimental studies. The system can capture both detailed interactions (using video recordings) and repeated observations (e.g. once per second for the entire day) of individuals over long timescales (months or potentially years). This approach opens the door to tracking life-long relationships among individuals, while also capturing fine-scale differences in behaviour."},

Despite the key role of brain in processing afferent and efferent information from organ systems to coordinate and optimize their functioning, little is known about how the brain works during exercise. The present study investigated tonic and transient oscillatory brain activity during a single bout of aerobic exercise. Twenty young males (19-32 years old) were recruited for two experimental sessions on separate days. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded during a session of cycling at 80% (moderate-to-high intensity) of VO2max (maximum aerobic capacity) while performing an oddball task where participants had to detect infrequent targets presented among frequent non-targets. This was compared to a (baseline) light intensity session (30% VO2max). The light intensity session was included to control for any potential effect of dual-tasking (i.e., pedaling and performing the oddball task). A warm-up and cool down periods were completed before and after exercise, respectively. A cluster-based nonparametric permutations test showed an increase in power across the entire frequency spectrum during the moderate-to-high intensity exercise, with respect to light intensity. Further, we found that the more salient target lead to lower increase in (stimulus-evoked) theta power in the 80% VO2max with respect to the light intensity condition. On the contrary, higher decrease alpha and lower beta power was found for standard trials in the moderate-to-high exercise condition than in the light exercise condition. The present study unveils, for the first time, a complex brain activity pattern during acute exercise (at 80% of maximum aerobic capacity). These findings might help to elucidate the nature of changes that occur in the brain during physical exertion."},

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can measure the activity of thousands of regulatory DNA sequences and their variants in a single experiment. With the increase in the number of MPRA datasets that are publically available, one can now develop functional-based models which, given a DNA sequence, predict its regulatory activity. Here we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of several MPRA datasets in a variety of cellular contexts. We first applied an ensemble of methods to accurately predict the MPRA output in each context, and observed that the most predictive features are consistent across data sets. We then demonstrate that predictive models trained in one cellular context can be used to accurately predict MPRA output in another, with mild loss of accuracy attributed to features that depend on the cell type. Finally, we study the extent to which MPRA can assist with the identification of genetic modifications that are associated with transcriptional changes to nearby genes. Our analysis provides insight into how MPRA data can be leveraged to highlight functional regulatory regions throughout the genome and can guide efficient design of future MPRA experiments."},

Here, we test the Neural Self-Information Theory that neural code is constructed via the self-information principle under which each inter-spike-interval (ISI) is inherently self-tagged with discrete information based on its relation to ISI variability-probability distribution - higher-probability ISIs, which reflect the balanced excitation-inhibition ground state, convey minimal information, whereas lower-probability ISIs, which signify statistical surprisals, carry more information. Moreover, temporally coordinated ISI surprisals across neural cliques intrinsically give rise to real-time cell-assembly neural code.  As a result, this self-information-based neural coding is uniquely intrinsic to the neurons themselves, with no need for outside observers to set any reference point to manually mark external or internal inputs. Applying this neural self-information concept, we devised an unbiased general decoding strategy and successfully uncovered 15 distinct cell-assembly patterns from multiple cortical and hippocampal circuits associated with different sleep cycles, earthquake, elevator-drop, foot-shock experiences, navigation or various actions in five-choice visual-discrimination operant-conditioning tasks.  Detailed analyses of all 15 cell assemblies revealed that ~20% of the skewed ISI distribution tails were responsible for the emergence of robust cell-assembly codes, conforming to the Pareto Principle. These findings support the notion that neural coding is organized via the self-information principle to generate real-time information across brain regions, cognitive modalities, and behaviors."},

We argue that brain plasticity is a systems level response, involving all cell classes, from neuron and glia to non-neuronal cells including endothelia.  Using molecular pathway analysis, we further propose a gene regulatory network that could couple activity dependent changes in neurons to adaptive changes in neurovasculature, and finally we show that transcriptional regulations observed in major brain disorders target genes that are modulated by altered sensory experience. Thus understanding the molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity of sensory maps might help to unravel the cellular events that shape brain plasticity in health and disease."},

Analyses of body fat, plasma hormone levels, and visceral white adipose tissue DNA methylome and transcriptome collectively indicate that the F4 obesity is consistent with a leptin resistant, \"thrifty phenotype\". Ancestral TBT exposure induces global changes in DNA methylation together with altered expression of metabolism-relevant genes when the F4 animals were exposed to dietary challenges. Analysis of chromatin accessibility in F3 and F4 sperm reveal significant differences between control and TBT groups and significant similarities between F3 and F4 TBT groups that overlap with areas of differential methylation in F4 adipose tissue. Taken together, our data suggest that ancestral TBT exposure induces changes in higher order chromatin organization transmissible through meiosis and mitosis."},

Taking advantage of genetic tractability of D. melanogaster, we characterized the first in vivo model of eIF6 upregulation. Drosophila eIF6 overexpression increases translation and results in a rough eye phenotype due to aberrant apoptosis. Mechanistically, eIF6 reshapes transcription and histone acetylation, disrupting the ecdysone network. This work is the first evidence of how increased translation generates a full transcriptional and hormonal dysregulation, providing new perspectives on the physiological relevance of the translational machinery in regulating gene expression and a model to screen drugs potentially useful to treat cells with altered eif6 gene dosage."},

We uncover high diversity of transcriptional states in Nematostella, demonstrating cell type-specific expression for 35% of the genes and 51% of the transcription factors (TFs) detected. We identify eight broad cell clusters corresponding to cell classes such as neurons, muscles, cnidocytes, or digestive cells. These clusters comprise multiple cell modules expressing diverse and specific markers, uncovering in particular a rich repertoire of cells associated with neuronal markers. TF expression and sequence analysis defines the combinatorial code that underlies this cell-specific expression. It also reveals the existence of a complex regulatory lexicon of TF binding motifs encoded at both enhancer and promoters of Nematostella tissue-specific genes. Whole organism single cell RNA-seq is thereby established as a tool for comprehensive study of genome regulation and cell type evolution."},

Chi-square analyses reveal that there are significant gaps in STEM recruitment and retention rates between URM and non-URM students, but when these students participate in the PLTL model, no differences in STEM recruitment or retention rates were observed. Additionally, we found that STEM retention rates were significantly improved for URM students who engaged in PLTL."},

Here, we investigated auditory sensory memory decay using a delayed matching-to-sample task with pure-tone sequences. First, in a behavioral experiment we modeled memory behavior over six different delay-phase durations. Second, in a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment, we assessed alpha-power modulations over three different delay-phase durations. In both experiments, the temporal expectation for the to be remembered sound was manipulated, so that it was either temporally expected or not. In both studies, memory performance declined over time but this decline was less strong under a more precise temporal expectation. Similarly, patterns of alpha power in and alpha-tuned connectivity between sensory cortices changed parametrically with delay duration (i.e., decrease in occipito-parietal regions, increase in temporal regions). Notably, temporal expectation counteracted alpha-power decline in heteromodal brain areas (i.e., supramarginal gyrus), in line with its memory-decay counteracting effect on performance. Correspondingly, temporal expectation also boosted alpha connectivity within attention networks known to play an active role during memory maintenance. The present data outline how patterns of alpha power orchestrate sensory memory decay, and encourage a refined perspective on alpha power and its inhibitory role across brain space and time."},

The phylogenetic placement of the only two major animal clades lacking these traits, poriferans (sponges) and placozoans, is crucial to this point, with the former having received much attention in recent years, and the latter relatively neglected. Here, adding new genome assemblies from three members of a previously unsampled placozoan lineage, and including a comprehensive dataset sampling the extant diversity of all other major metazoan clades and choanoflagellate outgroups, we test the positions of placozoans and poriferans using hundreds of orthologous protein-coding sequences. Surprisingly, we find strong support under well-fitting substitution models for a relationship between Cnidaria and Placozoa, contradicting a clade of Bilateria + Cnidaria (= Planulozoa) seen in previous work. This result is stable to Dayhoff 6-state recoding, a strategy commonly used to reduce artefacts from amino acid compositional heterogeneity among taxa, a problem to which the AT-rich Placozoa may be particularly susceptible. We also find that such recoding is sufficient to derive strong support for a first-splitting position of Porifera. In light of these results, it is necessary to reconsider the homology of eumetazoan traits not only between ctenophores and bilaterians, but also between cnidarians and bilaterians. Whatever traits are homologous between these taxa must also have occurred in the evolutionary history of Placozoa (or occur cryptically in modern forms), and the common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria may extend deeper into the Precambrian than is presently recognized."},

We find that 10 of the 21 mutagenized positions are optimal already in the wildtype Xbp1 AP, while certain mutations in the remaining residues lead to a strong increase in the arrest potency. Xbp1 has thus evolved to induce an intermediate level of translational arrest, and versions with much stronger arrest efficiency exist. We further show Xbp1- induced translational arrest is reduced in response to increased tension in the nascent chain, making it possible to carry out studies in mammalian systems of cotranslational processes such as membrane protein assembly and protein folding by using suitable Xbp1 AP variants as force sensors, as has been done previously in E. coli using bacterial APs."},

In this follow-up study, using a novel brain-network connectivity approach, we aimed to examine whether functional connectivity reflects a marker of ADHD remission, or an enduring deficit unrelated to ADHD outcome. Methods: High-density EEG was recorded in 110 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD (87 persisters, 23 remitters) and 169 typically-developing individuals during an arrow-flanker task, eliciting cognitive control. Functional connectivity was quantified with network-based graph-theory metrics before target onset (pre-stimulus), during target processing (post-stimulus) and in the degree of change between pre-stimulus/post-stimulus. ADHD outcome was examined with parent-reported symptoms and impairment using both a categorical (DSM-IV) and a dimensional approach. Results: Graph-theory measures converged in indicating that, compared to controls, ADHD persisters showed increased connectivity in pre-stimulus theta, alpha and beta and in post-stimulus beta (all p<.01), and reduced pre-stimulus/post-stimulus change in theta connectivity (p<.01). In the majority of indices showing ADHD persister-control differences, ADHD remitters differed from controls (all p<.05), but not from persisters. Similarly, connectivity measures were not associated with continuous outcome measures of ADHD symptoms and impairment in participants with childhood ADHD. Conclusions: Adolescents and young adults with persistent and remitted ADHD share atypical over-connectivity profiles and reduced ability to modulate connectivity patterns with task demands, compared to controls. Brain connectivity impairments may represent enduring deficits in individuals with childhood ADHD irrespective of diagnostic status in adolescence/young adulthood."},

Ross Otto", "Nathaniel Daw"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/201863 ", "abstract": "A spate of recent work demonstrates that humans seek to avoid the expenditure of cognitive effort, much like physical effort or economic resources. Less is clear, however, about the circumstances dictating how and when people decide to expend cognitive effort. Here we adopt a popular theory of opportunity costs and response vigor and to elucidate this question. This account, grounded in Reinforcement Learning, formalizes a trade-off between two costs: the harder work assumed necessary to emit faster actions and the opportunity cost inherent in acting more slowly (i.e., the delay that results to the next reward and subsequent rewards). Recent work reveals that the opportunity cost of time--operationalized as the average reward rate per unit time, theorized to be signaled by tonic dopamine levels, modulates the speed with which a person responds in a simple discrimination tasks. We extend this framework to cognitive effort in a diverse range of cognitive tasks, for which 1) the amount of cognitive effort demanded from the task varies from trial to trial and 2) the expenditure of cognitive effort holds measureable consequences in terms of accuracy and response time. In the domains of cognitive control, perceptual decision-making, and task-switching, we found that subjects tuned their level of effort exertion in accordance with the experienced average reward rate: when the opportunity cost of time was high, subjects made more errors and responded more quickly. That is, expenditure of cognitive effort appeared to be modulated by the opportunity cost of time. Further, and consistent with our account, the strength of this modulation was predicted by individual differences in efficacy of cognitive control. Taken together, our results elucidate the circumstances dictating how and when people expend cognitive effort."},
{"title": "An alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes", "authors": ["Koen Deforche"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/200394 ", "abstract": "Motivation: Biological sequence alignment is fundamental to their further interpretation. Current alignment algorithms typically align either nucleic acid or amino acid sequences. Using only nucleic acid sequence similarity, divergent sequences cannot be aligned reliably because of the limited alphabet and genetic saturation. To align divergent coding nucleic acid sequences, one can align using the translated amino acid sequences. This requires the detection of the correct open reading frame, is prone to eventual frame shift errors, and typically requires the treatment of genes separately. It was our motivation to design a nucleic acid sequence alignment algorithm to align a nucleic acid sequence against a (reference) genome sequence, that works equally well for similar and divergent sequences, and produces an optimal alignment considering simultaneously the alignment of all annotated coding sequences.\n\nResults: We define a genome alignment score for evaluating the quality of an alignment of a nucleic acid query sequence against a reference genome sequence, for which coding sequence features have been annotated (for example in a GenBank record). The genome alignment score combines the affine gap score for the nucleic acid sequence with an affine gap score for all amino acid alignments resulting from coding sequences in open reading frames contained within the query sequence. We present a Dynamic Programming algorithm to compute the optimal global or local alignment using this genomic alignment score and provide a formal proof of correctness. This algorithm allows the alignment of nucleic acid sequences from closely related and highly divergent sequences within the same software and using the same parameters, automatically correcting any eventual frame shift errors and produces at the same time the aligned translated amino acid sequences of all relevant coding sequence features.\n\nAvailability: The software is available as a web application at http://www.genomedetective.com/app/aga and as command-line application at https://github.com/emweb/aga"},

A main limitation in this direction, as well as with fundamental studies of brain function, is the variability observed in fMRI data. In practice, such measurements exhibit a mixture of session-to-session variability with subject- and condition-related information. Disentangling these contributions is crucial for real-life applications where only a few sessions per subject are available. The present study aims to define a new reliable standard for the extraction of signatures from fMRI data. These signatures correspond to subnetworks of directed interactions between brain regions (typically 100 covering the whole brain) supporting the subject and condition identification for single fMRI sessions. The key is to step from functional connectivity to effective connectivity, which is estimated using a whole-brain dynamic model. Our method shows that as few as 4 sessions per subject are sufficient to perfectly identify more than 40 other sessions of 6 subjects. We also demonstrate the good generalization capability for 30 subjects. Using another dataset with resting state and movie viewing, we show that the two extracted signatures correspond to distinct subnetworks, suggesting some sort of orthogonality. Our results set solid foundations to follow longitudinally a subject's condition from fMRI data."},

Here we present a suite of recently emerged technologies which make computational reproducibility not just possible, but, finally, practical in both time and effort. By combining a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and an integrated workflow system that automatically orchestrates the composition of these packages for entire pipelines, an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility can be achieved."},

At the same time, recent advances in machine learning have shown that deep neural networks can learn highly nonlinear functions for visual information processing. Two approaches based on deep learning have recently been successfully applied to neural data: transfer learning for predicting neural activity in higher areas of the primate ventral stream and data-driven models to predict retina and V1 neural activity of mice. However, so far there exists no comparison between the two approaches and neither of them has been used to model the early primate visual system. Here, we test the ability of both approaches to predict neural responses to natural images in V1 of awake monkeys. We found that both deep learning approaches outperformed classical linear- nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations building on existing V1 encoding theories. On our dataset, transfer learning and data-driven models performed similarly, while the data-driven model employed a much simpler architecture. Thus, multi-layer CNNs set the new state of the art for predicting neural responses to natural images in primate V1. Having such good predictive in-silico models opens the door for quantitative studies of yet unknown nonlinear computations in V1 without being limited by the available experimental time."},

In addition to its prevalence, Campylobacter is becoming increasingly resistant to the clinical antibiotics, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. As a result, public health agencies have identified drug resistant Campylobacter as a serious threat to public health and have suggested combating the pathogen at the farm-level by reducing its burden within agricultural animal reservoirs. Due to antibiotic restrictions in agricultural animals, reducing Campylobacter burden on the farm requires the identification and development of novel approaches. To this end, our group employed a broad sampling strategy to isolate a diverse collection of bacteriophages that can predate Campylobacter. We successfully isolated 70 bacteriophages from these samples and subjected them to whole-genome sequencing and initial comparative genomic analysis. Following this analysis, we performed dose-response assays by adding increasing concentrations of bacteriophage to C. jejuni cultures. From this work, we were able to identify diverse phage groups from multiple sources that correlated with robust inhibition of C. jejuni growth. Lastly, we employed transmission electron microscopy to examine the morphology of these bacteriophages and were able to confirm that genetic diversity reflected morphological diversity in these bacteriophages."},

We describe here the analysis of resting state EEG data collected from idiopathic RBD patients and healthy controls (HC) in a longitudinal study forming a balanced cohort of 178 subjects where a subset of RBD patients eventually developed either PD or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In earlier work (Soria-Frisch et al., 2014), we implemented support vector machine classifiers using EEG mean spectral features to predict the course of disease with an AUC of 85% in several classification problems, and, later, in Ruffini (2017a), an Echo State recurrent neural network that delivered high classification accuracy on balanced datasets. Here we investigate the data in a complementary way and describe the statistics of the global algorithmic complexity of these EEG multi-channel time series, which are analyzed as spectrograms (time-frequency plots). We provide an upper bound to algorithmic complexity using Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression (LZW) and entropy rate of the set of stacked spectrograms of 14 channels for each subject. Both LZW and entropy rate highlight strong statistically significant differences between the groups. Results are compared to those using the well-known ratio of fast to slow frequency power associated with slowing of EEG (Rodrigues-Brazete et al., 2016; Latreille et al., 2016), which they are seen to complement by picking up dynamical features of EEG spectral series. Poor prognosis in RBD appears to be associated with decreased temporal variability of the EEG spectrum, especially in beta and gamma frequencies."},

However, recent phylogenomic studies have revealed extensive gene tree-species tree discordance, which can lead to incorrect inferences of trait evolution if only a single species tree is used for analysis. This phenomenon--dubbed 'hemiplasy'--is particularly important to consider during analyses of character evolution in rapidly radiating groups, where discordance is widespread. Here we generate whole-transcriptome data for a phylogenetic analysis of 14 species in the plant genus Jaltomata (the sister clade to Solanum), which has experienced rapid, recent trait evolution, including in fruit and nectar color, and flower size and shape. Consistent with other radiations, we find evidence for rampant gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and several introgression events among the well-supported subclades. Since both ILS and introgression increase the probability of hemiplasy, we perform several analyses that take discordance into account while identifying genes that might contribute to phenotypic evolution. Despite discordance, the history of fruit color evolution in Jaltomata can be inferred with high confidence, and we find evidence of de novo adaptive evolution at individual genes associated with fruit color variation. In contrast, hemiplasy appears to strongly affect inferences about floral character transitions in Jaltomata, and we identify candidate loci that could arise either from multiple lineage-specific substitutions or standing ancestral polymorphisms. Our analysis provides a generalizable example of how to manage discordance when identifying loci associated with trait evolution in a radiating lineage."},

Conversely, the cost of transport for running is highly sensitive to gravity level but not much to speed. Gait optimization with a minimally constrained bipedal model predicts a similar differential energetic response for walking and running even though the same model parameters and cost function are used for both gaits. This challenges previous assertions that the converse energetic responses are due to fundamentally different energy saving mechanisms in each gait. Our results suggest that energetics of both gaits are highly influenced by dissipative losses occurring as leg forces abruptly alter the center of mass path. The observed difference in energetic consequence of the performance condition in each gait is due to the effect the movement strategy of each gait has on the dissipative loss. The optimization model predictions are tested directly by measuring metabolic cost of human subjects walking and running at different speeds in normal and reduced gravity using a novel reduced gravity simulation apparatus. The optimization model also predicts other, sometimes subtle, aspects of gait such as step length changes. This is also directly tested in order to assess the fidelity of the model's more nuanced predictions."},

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of ICC analysis in its prior usage in neuroimaging, and we show that the standard ANOVA framework is often limited, rigid, and inflexible in modeling capabilities. These intrinsic limitations motivate several improvements. Specifically, we start with the conventional ICC model under the ANOVA platform, and extend it along two dimensions: first, fixing the failure in ICC estimation when negative values occur under degenerative circumstance, and second, incorporating precision information of effect estimates into the ICC model. These endeavors lead to four modeling strategies: linear mixed-effects (LME), regularized mixed-effects (RME), multilevel mixed-effects (MME), and regularized multilevel mixed-effects (RMME). Compared to ANOVA, each of these four models directly provides estimates for fixed effects as well as their statistical significances, in addition to the ICC estimate. These new modeling approaches can also accommodate missing data as well as fixed effects for confounding variables. More importantly, we show that the MME and RMME approaches offer more accurate characterization and decomposition among the variance components, leading to more robust ICC computation. Based on these theoretical considerations and model performance comparisons with a real experimental dataset, we offer the following general-purpose recommendations. First, ICC estimation through MME or RMME is preferable when precision information (i.e., weights that more accurately allocate the variances in the data) is available for the effect estimate; when precision information is unavailable, ICC estimation through LME or the RME is the preferred option. Second, even though the absolute agreement version, ICC(2,1), is presently more popular in the field, the consistency version, ICC(3,1), is a practical and informative choice for whole-brain ICC analysis that achieves a well-balanced compromise when all potential fixed effects are accounted for. Third, approaches for clear, meaningful, and useful result reporting in ICC analysis are discussed. All models, ICC formulations, and related statistical testing methods have been implemented in an open source program 3dICC, which is publicly available as part of the AFNI suite. Even though our work here focuses on the whole brain level, the modeling strategy and recommendations can be equivalently applied to other situations such as voxel, region, and network levels."},

Our approach revealed sequence features affecting translation elongation and quantified the impact of large technical biases in ribosome profiling. We applied our model to design synonymous variants of a fluorescent protein spanning the range of possible translation speeds predicted with our model. We found that levels of the fluorescent protein in yeast closely tracked the predicted translation speeds across their full range. We therefore demonstrate that our model captures information determining translation dynamics in vivo, and that control of translation elongation alone is sufficient to produce large, quantitative differences in protein output."},

One such strategy is the identification of sequences of drugs exhibiting collateral sensitivity, wherein the evolution of resistance to a first drug renders a population more susceptible to a second. Here, we demonstrate that sequential multi-drug therapies derived from in vitro evolution experiments can have overstated therapeutic benefit - potentially suggesting a collaterally sensitive response where cross resistance ultimately occurs. The evolution of drug resistance need not be genetically or phenotypically convergent, and where resistance arises through divergent mechanisms, the efficacy of a second drug can vary substantially. We first quantify the likelihood of this occurring by use of a mathematical model parametrised by a set of small combinatorially complete fitness landscapes for Escherichia coli. We then verify, through in vitro experimental evolution, that a second-line drug can indeed stochastically exhibit either increased susceptibility or increased resistance when following a first. Genetic divergence is confirmed as the driver of this differential response through targeted sequencing. These results indicate that the present methodology of designing drug regimens through experimental collateral sensitivity analysis may be flawed under certain ecological conditions. Further, these results suggest the need for a more rigorous probabilistic understanding of the contingencies that can arise during the evolution of drug resistance."},

Migration patterns are often asymmetric and heterogeneous, with important consequences on the ecology and evolution of the species. Here we investigated experimentally how asymmetric migration and heterogeneous structure affect a simple metacommunity of budding yeast, formed by one strain that produces a public good and a non-producer strain that benefits from it. We find that asymmetric migration increases the fraction of producers in all subpopulations of the metacommunity. Furthermore, asymmetric migration decreases the metacommunity's tolerance to challenging environments, but increases its resilience to transient perturbations. This apparent paradox occurs because tolerance to a constant challenge depends on the weakest subpopulations of the network, while resilience to a transient perturbation depends on the strongest ones."},

Individual chromosomes of each pair have distinct parental origins and parental alleles are known to unequally contribute to cellular function. We integrated chromosome conformation (form) and gene transcription (function) analyses to dissect the dynamics of the maternal and paternal genomes in lymphoblastoid cells during the cell cycle. We found a distinct set of homologous alleles with very different activity often located close to boundaries of euchromatin and heterochromatin domains. We also identified a set of allele-biased topologically associating domains (TADs) that were small sized and had higher gene density. Thousands of genes show allelically biased expression (ABE) with false discovery rate < 0.05, and 98% of them have no allelic switching during G1, S, and G2/M phases. A subset of ABE genes are preferentially localized near TAD boundaries, enriched with chromatin organization transcription factor binding sites, and contained higher number of sequence variants in CCCTC-binding factor sites. Our results extend previous findings of sequence variation as a basis for unequal functional parental genomes.

Estimates for the relative fitness of resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains are highly heterogeneous, many are derived from in-vitro experiments and few studies have estimated relative fitness in the field. Measuring fitness in the field allows us to determine how the environment (including factors such as host genetics, TB treatment regimen etc.) influences the ability for bacteria to survive, be transmitted and cause secondary cases of disease. \nWe designed a household structured, stochastic mathematical model to estimate the fitness costs associated with multi-drug resistance (MDR) carriage in Mtb strains in Lima, Peru over a 3-year period. By fitting the model to data from a large prospective cohort study of TB disease in household contacts we estimated the fitness, relative to susceptible strains with a fitness of 1, of MDR-Mtb strains to be 0.33 (95% credible interval: 0.17-0.54) or 0.39 (0.26-0.58), if only transmission or progression to disease, respectively, was affected by MDR. The relative fitness of MDR-Mtb increased to 0.57 (0.43-0.73) when the fitness cost was modelled to influence both transmission and progression to disease equally. \nWe found the average relative fitness of MDR-Mtb circulating within households in Lima, Peru between 2010-2013 to be significantly lower than susceptible-Mtb circulating at the same time and location. If these fitness levels do not change, then existing TB control programmes are likely to keep MDR-TB prevalence at the current levels in Lima, Peru."},

In normal fibroblasts YAP1 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, while in activated cancer-associated fibroblasts it exhibits nuclear localization and promotes the expression of many genes required for pro-tumorigenic functions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of YAP1 shuttling in normal and activated fibroblasts, using EYFP-YAP1, quantitative photo- bleaching methods, and mathematical modeling. We find that both 14-3-3 and TEAD binding modulate YAP1 shuttling, but neither affects nuclear import. Instead, we find that YAP1 serine phosphorylation is required for nuclear export. Furthermore, YAP1 nuclear accumulation in activated fibroblasts results from Src and actomyosin-dependent suppression of phosphorylated YAP1 export. Finally, we show that nuclear constrained YAP1, upon XPO1 depletion, remains sensitive to blockade of actomyosin function. Together, these data place nuclear export at the center of YAP1 regulation and indicate that the cytoskeleton can regulate YAP1 within the nucleus."},

Codon-optimization of proviral DNA rescues viral translation, implying that IFITM-mediated restriction requires recognition of viral RNA elements. In addition, we find that expression of the viral accessory protein Nef can help overcome the IFITM-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis. Our studies identify a novel role for IFITMs in inhibiting HIV replication at the level of translation, but show that the effects can be overcome by the lentiviral protein Nef."},

For most \u03b1HVs, including the best-studied herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), viral latency is characterized by expression of a single or restricted set of transcripts that map antisense to the open reading frame (ORF) homologous to the major HSV immediate early viral transactivator, ICP0. These latency transcripts, either directly or through encoded miRNAs or proteins, repress expression of the ICP0 orthologues. The exception is varicella-zoster virus (VZV), an \u03b1HV which infects over 90% of adults and for which neither a canonical latency transcript nor a putative mechanism for repressing lytic transcription during latency have been identified. Here, we describe the discovery and functional characterization of a VZV latency transcript (VLT), that maps antisense to VZV ORF 61 (the VZV ICP0 homologue), and which is consistently expressed in neurons of latently infected human trigeminal ganglia (TG). VLT encodes a protein with late kinetics during lytic VZV infection in vitro and in zoster skin lesions. Whereas multiple alternatively spliced VLT isoforms are expressed during lytic VZV infection, a single unique VLT isoform that specifically suppresses ORF61 gene expression predominates in latently VZV-infected human TG. The discovery of VLT directly unifies the latent VZV transcription program with those of better-characterized \u03b1HVs, removing longstanding barriers to understanding VZV latency and paving the way for research into the development of vaccines that do not establish latency or reactivate, and drugs that eradicate latent VZV."},

Mutations occurred at these loci represent a significant source of genetic variation. Bumblebees are important pollinating insects occupying a wide range of habitats. However, to date, molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of bumblebees to such a diverse array of habitats are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigate how TRs contribute to genetic variation, thus potentially facilitating adaptation in bumblebees. We identified 26,595 TRs in the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) genome, 66.7% of which reside in genic regions. We also compared TRs found in B. terrestris with those present in the whole genome sequence of a congener, B. impatiens. We found a total of 1,137 TRs were variable in length between the two sequenced bumblebee species, and further analysis reveals that 101 of them are located within coding regions. Variable-length TRs in coding regions were confirmed by PCR. Functional classification of bumblebee genes where coding sequences include variable-length TRs suggests that a majority of those genes are related to transcriptional regulation. Our results show that TRs contribute to coding sequence variation in bumblebees and TRs may facilitate the adaptation of bumblebees through diversifying proteins involved in controlling gene expression."},

High anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs from agriculture and fossil fuel combustion have been recognized as a severe threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning such as control of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore it is important to understand how increased N input into pristine wetlands affects the composition and activity of micro-organisms, especially in interaction with dominant wetland plants. In a series of incubations analyzed over 90 days, we disentangle the effects of N fertilization on the microbial community in bulk soil and the rhizosphere of Juncus acutiflorus, a common and abundant graminoid wetland plant. We observed an increase in greenhouse gas emissions when N is increased in incubations with J. acutiflorus, changing the system from a greenhouse gas sink to a source. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomics, we determined that the bacterial orders Opitutales, Subgroup-6 Acidobacteria and Sphingobacteriales significantly responded to high N availability and we hypothesize that these groups are contributing to the increased greenhouse gas emissions. These results indicated that increased N input leads to shifts in microbial activity within the rhizosphere, severely altering N cycling dynamics. Our study provides a framework for connecting environmental conditions of wetland bulk and rhizosphere soil to the structure and metabolic output of microbial communities."},
{"title": "Stable centrosomal roots disentangle to allow interphase centriole independence", "authors": ["Robert Mahen"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/199166 ", "abstract": "The centrosome is a non-membrane bound cellular compartment consisting of two centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles must remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion) for cell migration, ciliary function and mitosis, yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion, and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable, bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles) in contrast do not form roots, and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing a discrete root. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent re-shuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Thus, collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either one or two interphase centrosomes, with implications for our understanding of how non-membrane bound organelles self-organise."},

We have discovered a simple genetic incompatibility that causes lethality in hybrids between two closely related species of yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus). This hybrid incompatibility, which causes one sixteenth of F2 hybrid seedlings to lack chlorophyll and die shortly after germination, occurs between sympatric populations that are connected by ongoing interspecific gene flow. Using complimentary genetic mapping and gene expression analyses, we show that lethality occurs in hybrids that lack a functional copy of the critical photosynthetic gene pTAC14. In M. guttatus, this gene was duplicated, but the ancestral copy is no longer expressed. In M. nasutus, the duplication is missing altogether. As a result, hybrids die when they are homozygous for the nonfunctional M. guttatus copy and missing the duplicate from M. nasutus, apparently due to misregulated transcription of key photosynthetic genes. Our study indicates that neutral evolutionary processes may play an important role in the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities and opens the door to direct investigations of their contribution to reproductive isolation among naturally hybridizing species."},

The objective of this research was to generate a skin microbiota baseline for members of the class Mammalia, testing the effects of host species, geographic location, body region, and biological sex. The back, torso, and inner thigh regions of 177 non-human mammals were collected to include representatives from 38 species and 10 mammalian orders. Animals were collected from local farms, zoos, households, and the wild. All samples were amplified using the V3-V4 16S rRNA gene region and sequenced using a MiSeq (Illumina). For reference, previously published skin microbiome data from 20 human participants, sampled using an identical protocol to the non-human mammals, were included in the analysis. Human skin was significantly less diverse than all other mammalian orders and the factor most strongly associated with community variation for all samples was whether the host was a human. Within non-human samples, host taxonomic order was the most significant factor influencing the skin community, followed by the geographic location of the habitat. By comparing the congruence between known host phylogeny and microbial community dendrograms, we observed that Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) and Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) had significant congruence, providing first evidence of phylosymbiosis between skin communities and their hosts."},

{"title": "A cautionary tale on using tumour growth rate to predict survival", "authors": ["Hitesh Mistry"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/109934 ", "abstract": "A recurrent question within oncology drug development is predicting phase III outcome for a new treatment using early clinical data. One approach to tackle this problem has been to derive metrics from mathematical models that describe tumour size dynamics termed re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth. They have shown to be strong predictors of overall survival in numerous studies but there is debate about how these metrics are derived and if they are more predictive than empirical end-points. This work explores the issues raised in using model-derived metric as predictors for survival analyses. Re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth were calculated for three large clinical studies by forward and reverse alignment. The latter involves re-aligning patients to their time of progression. Hence it accounts for the time taken to estimate re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth but also assesses if these predictors correlate to survival from the time of progression.  We found that neither re-growth rate nor time to tumour re-growth correlated to survival using reverse alignment. This suggests that the dynamics of tumours up until disease progression has no relationship to survival post progression. For prediction of a phase III trial we found the metrics performed no better than empirical end-points. These results highlight that care must be taken when relating dynamics of tumour imaging to survival and that bench-marking new approaches to existing ones is essential."},

For HIV/AIDS, the assumption of random mixing is inappropriate for epidemics that are concentrated in groups of people at high risk, including female sex workers (FSW) and their male clients (MCF), injecting drug users (IDU) and men who have sex with men (MSM). To find out who transmits infection to whom and how that affects the spread and containment of infection remains a major empirical challenge in the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Here we develop a technique, based on the routine sampling of infection in linked population groups (a social network of population types), which shows how an HIV/AIDS epidemic in Can Tho Province of Vietnam began in FSW, was propagated mainly by IDU, and ultimately generated most cases among the female partners of MCF (FPM). Calculation of the case reproduction numbers within and between groups, and for the whole network, provides insights into control that cannot be deduced simply from observations on the prevalence of infection. Specifically, the per capita rate of HIV transmission was highest from FSW to MCF, and most HIV infections occurred in FPM, but the number of infections in the whole network is best reduced by interrupting transmission to and from IDU. This analysis can be used to guide HIV/AIDS interventions using needle and syringe exchange, condom distribution and antiretroviral therapy. The method requires only routine data and could be applied to infections in other populations."},

The two TNF superfamily members, APRIL and BAFF even though were primarily studied  in lymphocyte maturation, they have also  been associated with tumor growth and aggressiveness in a number of solid tumors, including breast cancer. In the present work we studied the effect of APRIL and BAFF on  epithelial to mesenchymal transition and migration of breast cancer cells, and their action on the sub-population of cancer stem cells identified by autofluorescence and ALDH activity. Their action on an number of pluripotency genes was examined and breast cancer stem cell ability to form mammospheres was also utilized. The receptor and the signaling pathway involved as well as the role of steroid hormones in their action were also investigated. Our findings show that both APRIL and BAFF increase epithelial to mesenchymal transition and migratory capacity of breast cancer cells, as well as cancer stem cell numbers, by inducing pluripotency genes such as KLF4 and NANOG.  These effects are mediated by their common receptor BCMA and the JNK signaling pathway. Interestingly, androgens enhance APRIL transcription and subsequently its pluripotency effect. In conclusion, our data support the significant role of APRIL and BAFF in breast cancer disease progression and provide evidence for a new possible mechanism of therapy resistance, that could be particularly relevant in aromatase inhibitors-treated patients, were local androgen is increased."},

In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as behaviors arising from model-free reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which typically represent the expected value associated with the possible outcomes of each action before one of those actions is chosen. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as arising from mechanisms that are independent of outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits are acquired through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions, independent of outcome. We demonstrate how this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the dependence of formation rates on the reinforcement schedule. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data. This mapping may provide a new foundation for building robust and comprehensive models of the interaction of habits with other, more goal-directed types of behaviors, and help to better guide research into the neural mechanisms underlying control of instrumental behaviors more generally."},

Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate one's code, harming the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one's analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code, in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one's analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging tools. With Porcupine, we intend to bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of the analysis and thus create better reproducible and shareable science. We give the researcher a better oversight of their pipeline, both while developing and communicating their work.

We found that a similar pattern of neural ensemble activity was selectively recalled after reinforcement for a correct decision. This reinforcement-selective recall only reliably occurred immediately before the abrupt behavioural transitions indicating successful learning of the current rule, and faded quickly thereafter. We could simultaneously decode multiple, retrospective task events from the ensemble activity, suggesting the recalled ensemble activity had multiplexed encoding of prior events. Our results suggest that successful trial-and-error learning is dependent on reinforcement tagging the relevant features of the environment to maintain in prefrontal cortex short-term memory."},

We constructed an agent-based model of the Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis, which proposes that some fungi maintain an endophytic life stage to enhance dispersal and bridge gaps in substrate in space and time. We characterized the general conditions in which dispersal through leaves may be worth the metabolic and fitness costs of endophytism.

The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20-100%, 150 BAM files in total).

One aspect of cell division that plays a critical role in growth and development in multicellular organisms is the orientation of the division plane. Proper establishment of the division plane significantly contributes to normal organization of the plant body. One critical limitation to understanding division plane orientation lies in separating cell shape cues from mechanical or developmental regulation. We developed a probabilistic three-dimensional (3D) model of plant cell division that relies only on 3D cell shape, which allows us to quantitatively assess and separate the contribution of cell shape from other factors. One factor, four-way junction avoidance, in which plant cells place new walls so that they are offset from the existing walls of their neighbors, was demonstrated using this model. At a population level, the division predictions accurately predicted ~95% of in vivo cell divisions."},

We analyzed the microbiological composition of middle ear fluid (MEF) cultures and nasopharyngeal samples obtained before PCV7/13 rollout to identify bacterial factors influencing single- and mixed-species disease progression.\n\nMethods: Data included OM episodes submitted for MEF cultures during a 10-year prospective study in southern Israel and nasopharyngeal samples from unvaccinated asymptomatic children in the same population. We compared pneumococcal serotype diversity across carriage and disease isolates with and without NTHi co-isolation. We also measured associations between pneumococcal phenotype and rate of progression from colonization to OM in the presence and absence of NTHi.\n\nResults: Whereas pneumococcal serotype diversity in single-species OM is lower than in single-species colonization, serotype diversity does not differ significantly between colonization and OM in mixed-species episodes. Moreover, the pneumococcal serotype distribution of mixed-species OM corresponds more closely to that of mixed-species carriage than to the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes colonizing without NTHi. Pneumococcal phenotypes predicting prolonged carriage duration -- such as efficient metabolic properties and strong negative surface charge -- are associated with higher rate of progression to single-species OM. These factors are weaker predictors of the progression of mixed-species episodes.\n\nConclusions: Immune-evasive pneumococcal serotypes able to persist in the nasopharynx have elevated rates of progression to OM. However, these serotype differences in progression rate are attenuated in the presence of NTHi."},

We here provide the first evidence for an increased causal flow of heartbeat information from the right posterior insula to the anterior insula to the anterior cingulate cortex and from the right globus pallidus to the prefrontal cortices by sad faces.

In the present study, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the brain's temporally unfolding representations of different emotion constructs. First, participants rated 525 images on the dimensions of valence and arousal and by intensity of discrete emotion categories (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and sadness). Thirteen new participants then viewed subsets of these images within an MEG scanner. We used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare behavioral ratings to the unfolding neural representation of the stimuli in the brain. Ratings of valence and arousal explained significant proportions of the MEG data, even after corrections for low-level image properties. Additionally, behavioral ratings of the discrete emotions fear, disgust, and happiness significantly predicted early neural representations, whereas rating models of anger and sadness did not. Different emotion constructs also showed unique temporal signatures. Fear and disgust - both highly arousing and negative - were rapidly discriminated by the brain, but disgust was represented for an extended period of time relative to fear. Overall, our findings suggest that 1) dimensions of valence and arousal are quickly represented by the brain, as are some discrete emotions, and 2) different emotion constructs exhibit unique temporal dynamics. We discuss implications of these findings for theoretical understanding of emotion and for the interplay of discrete and dimensional aspects of emotional experience."},

It is also convenient to overlay the standard inverse variance weighted (IVW) estimate of causal effect as a fitted  slope, to see whether an individual SNP provides evidence that supports, or conflicts with, the overall consensus. Unfortunately, the traditional scatter plot is not the most appropriate means to achieve this aim whenever SNP-outcome associations are estimated with varying degrees of precision and this is reflected in the analysis.\n\nMethods: We propose instead to use a small modification of the scatter plot - the Galbraith radial plot  - for the presentation of data and results from an MR study, which enjoys many advantages over the original method. On a practical level it removes the need to recode the genetic data and enables a more straightforward detection of outliers and influential data points. Its use extends beyond the purely aesthetic, however, to suggest a more general modelling framework to operate within when conducting an MR study, including a new form of MR-Egger regression.\n\nResults: We illustrate the methods using data from a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to probe the causal effect of systolic blood pressure on coronary heart disease risk, allowing for the possible effects of pleiotropy. The radial plot is shown to aid the detection of a single outlying variant which is responsible for large differences between IVW and MR-Egger regression estimates. Several additional plots are also proposed for informative data visualisation \n\nConclusion: The radial plot should be considered in place of the scatter plot for visualising, analysing and interpreting data from a two-sample summary data MR study.

Despite a large number of studies, however, the timing of origination of crown Primates relative to the K-Pg boundary and the timing of diversification of the main crown groups remain controversial. Here we analysed a dataset of 372 taxa (367 Primates and 5 outgroups, 61 thousand base pairs) that includes nine complete primate genomes (3.4 million base pairs). We systematically explore the effect of different interpretations of fossil calibrations and molecular clock models on primate divergence time estimates. We find that even small differences in the construction of fossil calibrations can have a noticeable impact on estimated divergence times, especially for the oldest nodes in the tree. Notably, choice of molecular rate model (auto-correlated or independently distributed rates) has an especially strong effect on estimated times, with the independent rates model producing considerably more ancient estimates for the deeper nodes in the phylogeny.  We implement thermodynamic integration, combined with Gaussian quadrature, in the program MCMCTree, and use it to calculate Bayes factors for clock models.  Bayesian model selection indicates that the auto-correlated rates model fits the primate data substantially better, and we conclude that time estimates under this model should be preferred.  We show that for eight core nodes in the phylogeny, uncertainty in time estimates is close to the theoretical limit imposed by fossil uncertainties.  Thus, these estimates are unlikely to be improved by collecting additional molecular sequence data.  All analyses place the origin of Primates close to the K-Pg boundary, either in the Cretaceous or straddling the boundary into the Palaeogene"},

Direct selection for isolation is most likely to occur in the context of \"reinforcement\", where selection acts to increase prezygotic barriers to reduce the cost of heterospecific matings. Many studies of reinforcement focus on premating reproductive barriers, however postmating traits--such as conspecific sperm precedence (CSP)--can also respond to reinforcing selection. When CSP and intrapopulation sperm competition (ISC) share a genetic basis, selection for increased CSP in sympatric populations could alter ISC and the strength of sexual selection. We tested this prediction with the sister species Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, using two sympatric and two allopatric populations of D. pseudoobscura. We used a factorial sperm competition experiment to evaluate differences in CSP and ISC between sympatric and allopatric populations. Using multiple tester males across this factorial design also allowed us to estimate the opportunity for sexual selection within each population.  Consistent with a pattern of reinforcement, the sympatric populations had higher mean CSP. Reinforcement, in turn, decreased the average offensive sperm competitive ability specifically within these sympatric populations, allowing less opportunity for sexual selection to operate among conspecific males. These data demonstrate that strong reinforcing selection for reproductive isolation can have consequences for sexual selection and sexual interactions within species, in these important postmating sperm competition traits."},

Hundreds of lineages across animal phylogeny have secondarily lost larval forms, instead producing offspring that directly develop into adult form without a distinct larval ecological niche. Indirect development in the sea is typically planktotrophic: females produce large numbers of small offspring that require exogenous planktonic food to develop before metamorphosing into benthic juveniles. Direct development is typically lecithotrophic: females produce a smaller number of larger eggs, each developing into a juvenile without the need for larval feeding, provisioned by yolk. Evolutionary theory suggests that these alternative developmental strategies represent stable alternative fitness peaks, while intermediate states are disfavored. Transitions from planktotrophy to lecithotrophy thus require crossing a fitness valley and represent radical and coordinated transformations of life-history, fecundity, ecology, dispersal, and development.

Knowledge of the event labels considerably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species trees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the event types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled case may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here we investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation problem with horizontal transfer.  \n\nResults: We investigate the issue of time-consistency for the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a convenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of time-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak conditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which evolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an O(|V(T)|\\log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent reconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit timing maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking whether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic.  The algorithms are implemented in C++ using the boost graph library and are freely available at https://github.com/Nojgaard/tc-recon. \n\nSignificance: The combinatorial characterization of time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an important step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal transfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees. The fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context because it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree reconciliation problems."},

We characterized the development of these properties and their dependence on visual experience in ferrets. Visual experience was varied across three conditions: typical rearing, dark rearing, and dark rearing with daily exposure to simple sinusoidal gratings (14-16 hours total). Cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression were noted in the earliest observations, and did not vary considerably with experience. We also observed evidence of continued maturation of receptive field properties in the second month of visual experience: substantial length summation was observed only in the oldest animals (postnatal day 90); evoked firing rates were greatly increased in older animals; and direction selectivity required experience, but declined slightly in older animals.

Most researchers have utilized Aqp membranes for water purification purposes such as reverse and forward osmosis desalination of sea and brackish water and wastewater treatment. This paper investigated the permeation of aqueous ethanol across commercial aquaporin membranes for possible applications in ethanol dehydration in the process and biofuel refining industries.  The study revealed that rather than being selectively rejected, ethanol was able to diffuse through the membrane with minimal changes in composition from feed to permeate, even at low feed concentrations of ethanol. The total flux across the membranes were shown to average 3.86 liters/m2h (LMH). The presence of ethanol increased the relative rate of water transport across the membrane. When comparing total flux of pure water to aqueous ethanol solutions, the flux was higher for solutions containing any ethanol."},

A systematic approach to inferring gene regulatory networks has been provided by the R/Bioconductor package ELMER (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships), which first identifies DNA methylation changes in distal regulatory elements and correlates these with the expression of nearby genes to identify direct transcriptional targets. Next, ELMER performs a transcription factor binding motif analysis and integrates with expression profiling of all human transcription factors, to identify master regulatory TFs and place each differentially methylated regulatory element into the context of an altered gene regulatory network (GRN).\nHere we present a completely updated version of the package (ELMER v. 2.0), which uses the latest Bioconductor data structures including the popular MultiAsssayExperiment, supports multiple reference genome assemblies as well as the DNA methylation platforms Infinium MethylationEPIC and Infinium HumanMethylation450, and provides a 'Supervised' analysis mode for paired sample study designs (such as treated vs. untreated replicate samples). It also supports data import from the new NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) database. The new version is substantially re-written, improving stability, performance, and extensibility. It also uses improved databases for transcription factor binding domain families and binding motif specificities, and has newly designed output plots for publication-quality figures.\nBelow, we describe the methods and new features of ELMER v. 2.0 and present two use case demonstrating how the tool can be used to analyze TCGA data in either Unsupervised or Supervised mode. ELMER (v2.0.0) is available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://github.com/tiagochst/ELMER.

Given that animals are able to store memories of everyday experiences, hippocampal circuits should be able to avoid saturation of overall synaptic weight to preserve learning capacity. However, the underlying mechanism for this is still poorly understood. Here, we show that adult neurogenesis in rats plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the hippocampal learning capacity for learning. Artificial saturation with hippocampal LTP impaired learning capacity in contextual fear conditioning, which then completely recovered after 14 days, when LTP had decayed to the basal level. Ablation of neurogenesis by X-ray irradiation delayed the recovery of learning capacity, while enhancement of neurogenesis using running wheel sped up the recovery. Thus, one benefit of ongoing adult neurogenesis is the maintenance of hippocampal learning capacity through homeostatic renewing of hippocampal memory circuits. Decreased neurogenesis in aged animals may underlie declines in cognitive function with aging."},

Deterministic gene activation trajectories were computationally identified and experimentally substantiated at single cell resolution. A counterintuitive observation that Klf2 is required during resetting while  dispensable for self-renewal is explained by the contingency of factor availability. We tested 132 predictions formulated by the dynamic network, finding a predictive accuracy of 79.6%, and further show that this network accurately explains experimental observations of somatic  cell reprogramming.

Disruption of WDR11 expression in mouse and zebrafish results in phenotypic characteristics associated with defective Hh signalling, accompanied by dysgenesis of ciliated tissues.  Wdr11 null mice also exhibit early onset obesity. We found that WDR11 shuttles from the cilium to the nucleus in response to Hh signalling. WDR11 was also observed to regulate the proteolytic processing of GLI3 and cooperate with EMX1 transcription factor to induce the expression of downstream Hh pathway genes and gonadotrophin releasing hormone production. The CHH/KS-associated human mutations result in loss-of-function of WDR11. Treatment with the Hh agonist purmorphamine partially rescued the WDR11-haploinsufficiency phenotypes.

However, even leading age-prediction algorithms contain measurement error, motivating efforts to improve experimental pipelines. T1-weighted MRI is commonly used for age prediction, and the pre-processing of these scans involves normalisation to a common template and resampling to a common voxel size, followed by spatial smoothing. Resampling parameters are often selected arbitrarily. Here, we sought to improve brain-age prediction accuracy by optimising resampling parameters using Bayesian optimisation.\nUsing data on N=2001 healthy individuals (aged 16-90 years) we trained support vector machines to i) distinguish between young (<50 years) and old (>50 years) brains and ii) predict chronological age, with accuracy assessed using cross-validation. We also evaluated model generalisability to the Cam-CAN dataset (N=648, aged 18-88 years). Bayesian optimisation was used to identify optimal voxel size and smoothing kernel size for each task. This procedure adaptively samples the parameter space to evaluate accuracy across a range of possible parameters, using independent sub-samples to iteratively assess different parameter combinations to arrive at optimal values.\nWhen distinguishing between young and old brains a classification accuracy of 96.25% was achieved, with voxel size = 11.5mm3 and smoothing kernel = 2.3mm. For predicting chronological age, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.08 years was achieved, with voxel size = 3.73mm3 and smoothing kernel = 3.68mm. This was compared to performance using default values of 1.5mm3 and 4mm respectively, which gave a MAE = 5.48 years, a 7.3% improvement. When assessing generalisability, best performance was achieved when applying the entire Bayesian optimisation framework to the new dataset, out-performing the parameters optimised for the initial training dataset.\nOur study demonstrates the proof-of-principle that neuroimaging models for brain age prediction can be improved by using Bayesian optimisation to select more appropriate pre-processing  parameters. Our results suggest that different parameters are selected and performance improves when optimisation is conducted in specific contexts. This motivates use of optimisation techniques at many different points during the experimental process, which may result in improved statistical sensitivity and reduce opportunities for experimenter-led bias."},

The mechanism that allows chloroplasts to sort out and separate the intricate thylakoid membrane structures during organelle division remain unknown. By characterizing the sizes of thylakoids found in a number of different chloroplast division mutants in Arabidopsis, we show that thylakoids do not divide independently of the chloroplast division cycle. More specifically, we show that thylakoid division requires the formation of both the inner and the outer contractile rings of the chloroplast."},

We use the response to TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and a new general method for quantifying heterogenous responses to demonstrate that variable mitochondria abundance is a source of cell-to-cell variability that determines the fractional cell death response. By quantitative data analysis, modeling and single cell experiments we attribute this effect to variable concentrations of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax on the mitochondrial surface. Further, we demonstrate that inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, used in cancer treatment, may increase the diversity of cellular responses, enhancing resistance to the treatment."},

However, deleterious fitness effects of alleles can also be suppressed by compensatory adaptation. Compensatory mutations can act directly to reduce deleterious effects of an allele. Alternatively, compensation may also occur by altering other aspects of an organisms phenotype or performance, without suppressing the phenotypic effects of the deleterious allele. Moreover, the origin of allelic variation contributing to compensatory adaptation remains poorly understood. Compensatory evolution driven by mutations that arise during the selective process are well studied. However less is known about the role standing (cryptic) genetic variation plays in compensatory adaptation. To address these questions, we examined evolutionary trajectories of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster fixed for mutations that disrupt wing morphology, resulting in deleterious effects on several components of fitness. Lineages subjected only to natural selection, evolved modifications to courtship behavior and several life history traits without compensation in wing morphology. Yet, we observed rapid phenotypic compensation of wing morphology under artificial selection, consistent with segregating variation for compensatory alleles. We show that alleles contributing to compensation of wing morphology have deleterious effects on other fitness components. These results demonstrate the potential for multiple independent avenues for rapid compensatory adaptation from standing genetic variation, which ultimately may reveal novel adaptive trajectories."},

Here, we report the development of a tool for expression of the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in F. tularensis, which allows for the study of CD8+ T cell responses to the bacterium. We demonstrate that in response to intranasal infection with the F. tularensis Live Vaccine Strain, pathogen-specific CD8+ T cells expand after the first week and produce IFN-\u03b3 but not IL-17. Effector and central memory subsets develop with disparate kinetics in the lungs, draining lymph node and spleen.

We also show that intranasal vaccination leads to more pathogen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung-draining lymph node compared to scarification vaccination, but that an intranasal booster overcomes this difference. Together, our data show that this novel tool can be used to study multiple aspects of the CD8+ T cell response to F. tularensis.

Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals' decision-making, but methods available for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animal's behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. As a particular target, we applied this framework to thermotactic behavior in C. elegans. After identifying the behavioral strategy dependent on thermosensory state, we found it comprised mixture of two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). First, the DM is a strategy that the worms efficiently reach to specific temperature, which not only explained observation that the worms migrate toward the cultivated temperature, but also clarifies how the worms control thermosensory state through the migration. Second, the IM is a strategy that the worms track along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking well observed in previous studies. By further applying our method to starved worm and thermosensory neuron-deficient worms, we identified the neural basis underlying the strategies. Consequently, we interpreted behavioral strategies in terms of control theory. Therefore, this study validates and presents a novel approach that should propel the development of new, more effective experiments to identify behavioral strategies and decision-making in animals."},

In the Solomon Islands, the prevalence of Ct among children is low despite the prevalence of active trachoma being moderate. We therefore set out to investigate whether active trachoma was associated with a common non-chlamydial infection or with a dominant polymicrobial community dysbiosis in the Solomon Islands.\n\nMethods\nWe studied DNA from conjunctival swabs collected from 257 Solomon Islanders with active trachoma and matched controls. Droplet digital PCR was used to test for pathogens suspected to be able to induce follicular conjunctivitis. Polymicrobial community diversity and composition were studied by sequencing of hypervariable regions of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene in a subset of 54 cases and 53 controls.\n\nResults\nAlthough Ct was associated with active trachoma, the number of infections was low (cases: 3.9%, controls: 0.4%). Estimated prevalence (cases, controls) of each non-chlamydial infection was as follows: S. aureus (1.9%, 1.9%), Adenoviridae (1.2%, 1.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (5.8%, 4.3%), H. influenzae (7.4%, 11.7%), M. catarrhalis (2.3%, 4.7%) and S. pneumoniae (7.0%, 6.2%). There was no statistically significant association between clinical signs of trachoma and presence or load of any of the non-Ct infections that were assayed. Inter-individual variations in the conjunctival microbiome were characterised by differences in the levels of Corynebacterium, Proprionibacterium, Helicobacter and Paracoccus, but diversity and relative abundance of these specific genera did not differ significantly between cases and controls. \n\nDiscussion\nIt is unlikely that the prevalent trachoma-like follicular conjunctivitis in the Solomon Islands has a dominant bacterial aetiology. Before implementing community-wide azithromycin distribution for trachoma, policy makers should consider that clinical signs of trachoma can be observed in the absence of any detectable azithromycin-susceptible organism."},

The current study aimed to understand the developmental signaling cues that regulate bud tip progenitor cells in the human fetal lung, which are present during branching morphogenesis, and to use this information to induce a bud tip progenitor-like population from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro.  We identified that FGF7, CHIR-99021 and RA maintained isolated human fetal lung epithelial bud tip progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state in vitro, and led to the induction of a 3-dimensional lung-like epithelium from hPSCs. 3-dimensional hPSC-derived lung tissue was initially patterned, with airway-like interior domains and bud tip-like progenitor domains at the periphery. Epithelial bud tip-like domains could be isolated, expanded and maintained as a nearly homogeneous population by serial passaging. Comparisons between human fetal lung epithelial bud tip cells and hPSC-derived bud tip-like cells were carried out using immunostaining, in situ hybridization and transcriptome-wide analysis, and revealed that in vitro derived tissue was highly similar to native lung. hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip-like structures survived in vitro for over 16 weeks, could be easily frozen and thawed and maintained multi-lineage potential. Furthermore, hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip progenitors successfully engrafted in the proximal airways of injured immunocompromised NSG mouse lungs, where they persisted for up to 6 weeks and gave rise to several lung epithelial lineages."},

Experiments are carefully designed, comparing wildtype strains with knockout strains, and replications are conducted to capture biological variation. To maintain monoclonal strains, strain preservation systems are used to keep the number of generations between the primary stock and the experimental measurement low, to decrease the influence of spontaneous mutations on the experimental outcome. The impact of spontaneous mutations during the minimal number of growth cycles for the experimental design is, however, poorly studied.\n\nResults: We set out to characterize the mutation landscape using a transcriptomic dataset of Schizophyllum commune, a laboratory model for mushroom formation. We designed a methodology to detect SNPs from the RNA-seq data, and found a mutation rate of 1.923 10-8 per haploid genome per base per generation, highly similar to the previously described mutation rate of S. commune in the wild. Our results imply that approximately 300 mutations are generated during growth of a colony on an agar plate, of which 5 would introduce stop codons. Knock-outs did not incur an increase of mutations and chromosomal recombination occurring at mating type loci was frequent. We found that missense and nonsense SNPs were selected against throughout the experiment. Also, most mutations show a low variant allele frequency and appear only in a small part of the population. Yet, we found 40 genes that gained a nonsense mutation affecting one of its annotated protein domains, and more than 400 genes having a missense mutation inside an annotated protein domain. Further, we found transcription factors, metabolic genes and cazymes having gained a mutation. Hence, the mutation landscape is wide-spread and has many functional annotations.\n \nConclusions:  We have shown that spontaneous mutations accumulate in typical microorganism experiments, where one usually assumes that these do not happen. As these mutations possibly confound experiments they should be minimized as much as possible, or, at least, be trackable. Therefore, we recommend labs to ensure that biological replicates originate from different parental plates, as much as possible."},

We exemplify its utility by isolating single cortical columns and laminae from the mouse primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Tissues can be isolated from living slices in minutes, and the extracted RNA and protein are of sufficient quantity and quality to be used for RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry. This technique will help to increase the anatomical specificity of molecular studies of the neocortex, and the brain in general as it is applicable to any brain structure that can be identified using optical landmarks in living slices."},

Multicellularity opens up opportunities for innovations in intercellular communication, cooperation, and specialization, which can provide selective advantages under certain ecological conditions. The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has never had a multicellular ancestor yet it is closely related to the volvocine algae, a clade containing taxa that range from simple unicells to large, specialized multicellular colonies. Simple multicellular structures have been observed to evolve in C. reinhardtii in response to predation or to settling rate-based selection. Structures formed in response to predation consist of individual cells grouped within a shared transparent extracellular matrix. Evolved isolates form such structures obligately under culture conditions in which their wild type ancestors do not, indicating that newly-evolved multicellularity is heritable. C. reinhardtii is capable of photosynthesis, and possesses an eyespot and two flagella with which it moves towards or away from light in order to optimize input of radiant energy. Motility contributes to C. reinhardtii fitness because it allows cells or colonies to achieve this optimum. Utilizing phototaxis to assay motility, we determined that newly evolved multicellular strains do not exhibit significant directional movement, even though the flagellae of their constituent unicells are present and active. In C. reinhardtii the first steps towards multicellularity in response to predation appear to result in a trade-off between motility and differential survivorship, a trade-off that must overcome by further genetic change to ensure the long-term success of the new multicellular organism."},

Identifying the genetic basis underpinning resistance allows for rapid diagnosis and treatment. XDR isolates sourced from Greece and Brazil, including nineteen polymyxin-resistant and five polymyxin-susceptible strains, underwent whole genome sequencing. Approximately 90% of polymyxin resistance was enabled by alterations upstream or within mgrB. The most common mutation identified was an insertion at nucleotide position 75 in mgrB via an ISKpn26-like element in the ST258 lineage and ISKpn13 in one ST11 isolate. Three strains acquired an IS1 element upstream of mgrB and another strain had an ISKpn25 insertion at 133 bp. Other isolates had truncations (C28STOP, Q30STOP) or a missense mutation (D31E) affecting mgrB. Complementation assays revealed all mgrB perturbations contributed to resistance. Missense mutations in phoQ (T281M, G385C) were also found to facilitate resistance. Several variants in phoPQ co-segregating with the ISKpn26-like insertion were identified as potential partial suppressor mutations. Three ST258 samples were found to contain subpopulations with different resistance conferring mutations, including the ISKpn26-like insertion colonising with a novel mutation in pmrB (P158R), both confirmed via complementation assays. We also characterized a new multi-drug resistant Klebsiella quasipneumoniae strain ST2401 which was susceptible to polymyxins. These findings highlight the broad spectrum of chromosomal modifications which can facilitate and regulate resistance against polymyxins in K. pneumoniae."},

However, the integration of various sources of information remains a challenge for systems biology since produced datasets are often of heterogeneous types, with the need of developing generic methods to take their different specificities into account. We propose a multiple kernel framework that allows to integrate multiple datasets of various types into a single exploratory analysis. Several solutions are provided to learn either a consensus meta-kernel or a meta-kernel that preserves the original topology of the datasets. We applied our framework to analyse two public multi-omics datasets. First, the multiple metagenomic datasets, collected during the TARA Oceans expedition, was explored to demonstrate that our method is able to retrieve previous findings in a single KPCA as well as to provide a new image of the sample structures when a larger number of datasets are included in the analysis. To perform this analysis, a generic procedure is also proposed to improve the interpretability of the kernel PCA in regards with the original data. Second, the multi-omics breast cancer datasets, provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas, is analysed using a kernel Self-Organizing Maps with both single and multi-omics strategies. The comparison of this two approaches demonstrates the benefit of our integration method to improve the representation of the studied biological system. Proposed methods are available in the RR package mixKernel, released on CRAN. It is fully compatible with the mixOmics package and a tutorial describing the approach can be found on mixOmics web site http://mixomics.org/mixkernel/."},

Twin studies have suggested a high (50-60%) heritability, but genetic determinants are largely unknown.\n\nAims: In this study, our aim was to study genetic variation associated with muscular strength in a large sample of 334,925 individuals of European descent from the UK Biobank, and to evaluate shared genetic aetiology with and causal effects of grip strength on physical and cognitive health.\n\nMethods and Results: In our discovery analysis of 223,315 individuals, we identified 101 loci associated with grip strength at genome-wide significance (P<5e-8). Of these, 64 were associated (P<0.01 and consistent direction) also in the replication dataset (N=111,610). Many of the lead SNPs were located in or near genes known to have a function in developmental disorders (FTO, SLC39A8, TFAP2B, TGFA, CELF1, TCF4, BDNF, FOXP1, KIF1B, ANTXR2), and one of the most significant genes based on a gene-based analysis (ATP2A1) encodes SERCA1, the critical enzyme in calcium uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which plays a major role in muscle contraction and relaxation. Further, we demonstrated a significant enrichment of gene expression in brain-related transcripts among grip strength associations. Finally, we observed inverse genetic correlations of grip strength with cardiometabolic traits, and positive correlation with parents' age of death and education; and showed that grip strength was causally related to fitness, physical activity and other indicators of frailty, including cognitive performance scores.\n\nConclusions: In our study of over 330,000 individuals from the general population, the genetic findings for hand grip strength suggest an important role of the central nervous system in strength performance.

We show that spike-timing patterns of interneurons and various projection neurons - including cortical excitatory principal cells, hippocampal pyramidal cells, inhibitory striatal medium spiny neurons, as well as dopaminergic neurons - all conform to the gamma distribution model.  Moreover, gamma shapes of spike-timing patterns remain robust over different states - such as sleep and awake periods and under fearful events.   Interestingly, there are significant regional variations of the spike-timing's regularities - that is, DA neurons, the somatosensory cortex and motor cortices showing increased regularity, whereas the V1 cortex, retrosplenial cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus tend to exhibit greater irregularity.  Furthermore, we observe that ketamine-induced anesthesia largely deranges the gamma-like spike-timing patterns. Such a conserved gamma distribution pattern, coupled with characteristic regional variations, may influence how spike-timing patterns exert dynamic actions on neural coding and network-level plasticity."},

We found faster response times for within-room egocentric spatial judgments and behavioural priming effects of visiting the same room, providing evidence for a compartmentalised representation of space. At the neural level, we observed a hierarchical encoding of 3D spatial information, with left anterior hippocampus representing local information within a room, while retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex and posterior hippocampus represented room information within the wider building. Of note, both our behavioural and neural findings showed that vertical and horizontal location information was similarly encoded, suggesting an isotropic representation of 3D space even in the context of a multi-compartment environment.

Although the cycle was already proposed in 1954, it is still subject of intense research, and even the structure of the cycle, i.e. the exact series of reactions, is still under debate. The controversy about the cycle's structure was fuelled by the findings of Gibbs and Kandler in 1956 and 1957, when they observed that radioactive 14 CO 2 was dynamically incorporated in hexoses in a very atypical and asymmetrical way, a phenomenon later termed the 'photosynthetic Gibbs effect'. Now, it is widely accepted that the photosynthetic Gibbs effect is not in contradiction to the reaction scheme proposed by Calvin, Benson and Bassham, but the arguments given have been largely qualitative and hand-waving. To fully appreciate the controversy and to understand the difficulties in interpreting the Gibbs effect, it is illustrative to illuminate the history of the discovery of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle. We here give an account of central scientific advances and discoveries, which were essential prerequisites for the elucidation of the cycle. Placing the historic discoveries in the context of the modern textbook pathway scheme illustrates the complexity of the cycle and demonstrates why especially dynamic labelling experiments are far from easy to interpret. We conclude by arguing that only mathematical models based on a sound theory are capable of resolving conflicting interpretations and providing a consistent quantitative explanation."},

Many experimental and polymer modeling efforts are dedicated to deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. Chromosomes are long and densely packed - topologically constrained - polymers. The main challenge is therefore to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate properly the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. Here, we develop a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers. Accounting accurately for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, we show that our simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and to go beyond the current limitations by studying long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. We use our formalism to investigate in details the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle."},

In particular, the protein-protein interactions that allow for the massive structural transition between the tightly organized interphase centrosome and the highly expanded matrix-like arrangement of the mitotic centrosome have been largely uncharacterized. Among the proteins that undergo a major transition is the Drosophila melanogaster protein centrosomin that contains a conserved carboxyl terminus motif, CM2. Recent crystal structures have shown this motif to be dimeric and capable of forming an intramolecular interaction with a central region of centrosomin. Here we use a combination of in-cell microscopy and in vitro oligomer assessment to show that dimerization is not necessary for CM2 recruitment to the centrosome and that CM2 alone undergoes a significant cell cycle dependent rearrangement. We use NMR binding assays to confirm this intramolecular interaction and show that residues involved in solution interactions are consistent with the published crystal structure and identify L1137 as critical for binding. Additionally, we show for the first time an in vitro interaction of CM2 with the Drosophila pericentrin-like-protein that exploits the same set of residues as the intramolecular interaction. Furthermore, NMR experiments reveal a calcium sensitive interaction between CM2 and calmodulin. Although unexpected because of sequence divergence, this suggests that centrosomin-mediated assemblies, like the mammalian pericentrin, may be calcium regulated.  From these results we suggest a model where during interphase CM2 interacts with pericentrin-like-protein to form a layer of centrosomin around the centriole wall and that at the onset of mitosis this population acts as a nucleation site of intramolecular centrosomin interactions that support the expansion into the metaphase matrix."},

This article reports a novel method for detecting such reactivation in standard sleep recordings. During learning, participants produced a complex sequence of finger presses, with each finger cued by a distinct audio-visual stimulus. Auditory cues were then re-played during subsequent sleep to trigger neural reactivation through a method known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR).  Next, we used electroencephalography data from the learning session to train a machine learning classifier, and then applied this classifier to sleep data to determine how successfully each tone had elicited memory reactivation. Above chance classification was significantly higher in slow wave sleep than in stage 2, suggesting differential efficacy of TMR in these two sleep stages. Interestingly, classification success reduced across numerous repetitions of the tone cue, suggesting either a gradually reducing responsiveness to such cues or a plasticity-related change in the neural signature as a result of cueing. We believe this method will be invaluable for future investigations of memory consolidation."},

Tribe's fully-featured API allows users to interact with Tribe programmatically if desired. Tribe implements the OAuth 2.0 standard as well as gene identifier mapping, which facilitates its integration into existing servers. Access to Tribe's resources is facilitated by an easy-to-install Python application called tribe-client.

The likelihood of transition from one behavioral pattern to another is malleable by experience and confers flexibility to the behavioral repertoire. Experience-dependent modification of innate aggressive behavior in flies alters fighting strategies during fights and establishes dominant-subordinate relationships. Dominance hierarchies resulting from agonistic encounters are consolidated to longer lasting social status-dependent behavioral modifications resulting in a robust loser effect. \nWe show that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dynamics regulated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, Rut and the cAMP phosphodiesterase, Dnc but not the Amn gene product, in specific neuronal groups of the mushroom body and central complex, mediate behavioral plasticity necessary to establish dominant-subordinate relationships. rut and dnc mutant flies are unable to alter fighting strategies and establish dominance relationships during agonistic interactions. This real-time flexibility during a fight is independent of changes in aggression levels.

As a result, reference gene collections remain incomplete: many gene models are fragmentary, while thousands more remain uncatalogued - particularly for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To accelerate lncRNA annotation, the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA Capture Long Seq (CLS), combining targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. We present an experimental re-annotation of the GENCODE intergenic lncRNA population in matched human and mouse tissues, resulting in novel transcript models for 3574 / 561 gene loci, respectively. CLS approximately doubles the annotated complexity of targeted loci, outperforming existing short-read techniques. Full-length transcript models produced by CLS enable us to definitively characterize the genomic features of lncRNAs, including promoter- and gene-structure, and protein-coding potential. Thus CLS removes a longstanding bottleneck of transcriptome annotation, generating manual-quality full-length transcript models at high-throughput scales."},

The answer to this seemingly simple question necessitates that we specify the nature of perceptual representations on which decisions are based. Recent work has taken for granted that the representation at the decision stage consists of a full probability distribution over all possible stimuli. However, to date, no empirical evidence has supported this assumption. Here I present five possible perceptual representation schemes that allow the extraction of different levels of sensory uncertainty. I review the empirical evidence from both continuous and discrete judgments and show that, at present, only the most primitive scheme based on a single point estimate can be rejected. In other words, at least four different representational schemes are consistent with the available data and therefore full probability distributions cannot be assumed. There is an urgent need for empirical research to adjudicate between these theoretical possibilities."},

We recently proposed that the second messenger (p)ppGpp drives Escherichia coli persister formation through protease Lon and the activation of toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules. This model found support in the field, but also generated controversy as part of recent heated debates on the validity of significant parts of the literature. In this study, we therefore used our previous work as a model to critically examine common experimental procedures in order to understand and overcome the inconsistencies often observed between results of different laboratories. Our results show that seemingly simple antibiotic killing assays are very sensitive to variation of culture conditions and bacterial growth phase. Additionally, we found that some assay conditions cause the killing of antibiotic-tolerant persisters via induction of cryptic prophages. Similarly, the inadvertent infection of mutant strains with bacteriophage \u03d580, a notorious laboratory contaminant, has apparently caused several phenotypes that we reported in our previous studies. We therefore reconstructed all infected mutants and probed the validity of our model of persister formation in a refined assay setup that uses robust culture conditions and unravels the dynamics of persister cells through all bacterial growth stages. Our results confirm the importance of (p)ppGpp and Lon, but do not anymore support a role of TA modules in E. coli persister formation.

To be used in precision medicine, genomic findings must be robust, reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to FAIR Data Guiding Principles. Moreover, precision medicine requires standardization that extends beyond wet lab procedures to computational methods. Rapidly developing technologies improves bioinformatics communication in genomic sequencing by introducing concepts such as error domain, usability domain, validation kit, and provenance information. These advancements allow data provenance to be standardized and ensure interoperability. Thus, a resulting bioinformatics computation instance that includes these advancements can be easily communicated to and repeated and compared by scientists, regulators, clinicians and others, allowing a greater range of practical application. Advancing clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions requires an umbrella of standards that not only fuses these elements, but also ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses. Through standardized bundling of HTS studies under an umbrella, regulatory agencies (FDA), academic researchers, and clinicians can expand collaboration to drive innovation in precision medicine with the potential for decreasing the time and cost associated with NGS workflow exchange, including FDA regulatory review submissions."},

Methods: One hundred replicates of various scenarios were performed. Scenarios followed a common overall structure but differed in the strategy used to identify elite donors and how these donors were used in the product development part.  Results: The results of this study showed that using surrogate sire technology would significantly increase the genetic merit of commercial sires, by as much as 6.5 to 9.2 years worth of genetic gain compared to a conventional breeding program. The simulations suggested that an identification strategy involving three-stages, the first of which uses genomic selection while the subsequent stages use progeny testing was the most effective strategy of all of those tested.  Conclusions: The use of one or a handful of elite donors to generate the production animals would be very different to current practice. While the results demonstrate the great potential of surrogate sire technology there are considerable risks but also other opportunities. Practical implementation of surrogate sire technology would need to account for these."},

To probe this, we induced adaptive changes to the temporal structure of birdsong. We find that the duration of specific song segments can be modified without affecting the timing in other parts of the song. We derive formal prescriptions for how neural networks can implement such flexible motor timing. We find that randomly connected recurrent networks, a common approximation for how neocortex is wired, do not generally conform to these, though certain implementations can approximate them. We show that feedforward networks, by virtue of their one-to-one mapping between network activity and time, are better suited. Our study provides general prescriptions for pattern generator networks that implement flexible motor timing, an important aspect of many motor skills, including birdsong and human speech."},

Previous research has focussed on generic time-scales (for example, delta or theta bands) that are assumed to map onto linguistic features such as prosody or syllables.  However, given the high inter-subject variability in speaking patterns, such a generic association between the time-scales of brain activity and speech properties can be ambiguous. Here, we analyse speech tracking in source-localised magnetoencephalographic data by directly focusing on time-scales extracted from statistical regularities in the speech material. This revealed widespread tracking at the time-scales of phrases (0.6 - 1.3 Hz), words (1.8 - 3 Hz), syllables (2.8 - 4.8 Hz), and phonemes (8 - 12.4 Hz). Importantly, when examining the relevance for single-trial comprehension, we found stronger tracking for correctly comprehended trials in the left premotor cortex at the phrasal scale, and in left middle temporal cortex at the word scale. Control analyses using generic bands confirmed that these effects were specific to the stimulus-tailored speech regularities. Furthermore, we found that the phase at the phrasal time-scale coupled to beta-power in motor areas. This cross-frequency coupling likely mediates the comprehension effect in the motor system, and implies top-down temporal prediction in speech perception. Together, our results reveal specific functional and perceptually relevant roles of distinct entrainment processes along the auditory-motor pathway. These processes act concurrently at time-scales within the traditional delta band and highlight the role of neural tracking mechanisms that reflect the temporal characteristics of speech."},

The most common TMM is based on the action of telomerase, but in some cancers telomeres are elongated via homologous recombination based alternative mechanism (ALT). Despite their importance, little is known about TMM regulation and factors responsible for TMM phenotype choice in different cells. Currently, many studies address the involvement of few genes in TMMs, but a consensus unified picture of the full process is missing. \nWe have developed a computational biology framework combining knowledge- and data-driven approaches to aid in understanding of TMMs. It is based on a greedy algorithm with three core modules: (1) knowledge-based construction/modification of molecular pathways for telomerase-dependent and alternative TMMs, (2) coupled with gene expression data-based validation with an in-house pathway signal flow (PSF) algorithm, and (3) iteration of these two coupled steps until converging at pathway topologies that best reflect state of the art knowledge and are in maximum accordance with the data. We have used gene expression data derived from cell lines and tumor tissues and have performed extensive literature search and multiple cycles of greedy iterations until reaching TMM assessment accuracy of 100% and 77%, respectively. \nAvailability of TMM pathways that best reflect recent knowledge and data will facilitate better understanding of TMM processes. As novel experimental findings in TMM biology emerge, and new datasets are generated, our approach may be used to further expand/improve the pathways, possibly allowing for making distinctions not only between telomerase-dependent and ALT TMMs, but also among their different subtypes. Moreover, this method may be used for assessment of TMM phenotypes from gene expression data, which is crucial for studies where experimental detection of TMM states is missing. Furthermore, it can also be used to assess TMM activities in proliferating healthy cells."},

These authors proposed an extension of a Gaussian Process (GP) nonparametric inferential method for the intensity function of non-homogeneous Poisson processes. They found that not only the statistical properties of the estimators were improved with their method, but also, that key aspects of the demographic histories were recovered. The authors' work represents the first Bayesian nonparametric solution to this inferential problem because they specify a convenient prior belief without a particular functional form on the population trajectory. Their approach works so well and provides such a profound understanding of the biological process, that the question arises as to how truly \"biology-free\" their approach really is. Using well-known concepts of stochastic population dynamics, here I demonstrate that in fact, Palacios and Minin's GP model can be cast as a parametric population growth model with density dependence and environmental stochasticity. Making this link between population genetics and stochastic population dynamics modeling provides novel insights into eliciting biologically meaningful priors for the trajectory of the effective population size. The results presented here also bring novel understanding of GP as models for the evolution of a trait. Thus, the ecological principles foundation of Palacios and Minin (2013)'s prior adds to the conceptual and scientific value of these authors' inferential approach.

We report in rats that PCP (5mg/kg i.p.) impairs a well-learned hippocampus-dependent place avoidance behavior in rats that requires cognitive control, even when PCP is injected directly into dorsal hippocampus. PCP increases 60-100 Hz medium gamma oscillations in hippocampus CA1 and these increases correlate with the cognitive impairment caused by systemic PCP administration. PCP discoordinates theta-modulated medium and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 local field potentials (LFP) such that medium gamma oscillations become more theta-organized than slow gamma oscillations. CA1 place cell firing fields are preserved under PCP but the drug discoordinates the sub-second temporal organization of discharge amongst place cells. This discoordination causes place cell ensemble representations of a familiar space to cease resembling pre-PCP representations, despite preserved place fields. These findings point to the cognitive impairments caused by PCP arising from neural discoordination. PCP disrupts the timing of discharge with respect to the sub-second timescales of theta and gamma oscillations in the LFP. Because these oscillations arise from local inhibitory synaptic activity, these findings point to excitation-inhibition discoordination as the root of PCP-induced cognitive impairment."},

Some preclinical evidence suggests that sex and sex hormone-dependent prenatal brain organization may interact with the opioid system to influence alcohol drinking behavior. We genotyped 200 alcohol-dependent patients and 240 healthy individuals for the A118G variant and measured serum \u03b2-endorphin level at recruitment and during acute withdrawal. We then evaluated the association between these factors and alcohol dependence risk and outcome in the context of both sex and second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D) - a biomarker of prenatal sex hormone load. For the first time, the AA genotype was found to be associated with elevated alcohol-related hospital readmission risk, more readmissions, and fewer days until first readmission in male but not female patients. Upon accounting for 2D:4D, the G-allele predicted alcohol dependence and more readmissions (1 vs \u22652) in males, suggesting prenatal sex hormones interact with OPRM1 to influence addiction pathology. Withdrawal \u03b2-endorphin level also correlated negatively with withdrawal severity in females but not in males, indicating \u03b2-endorphin might protect against withdrawal-induced stress in a sex-specific manner.

However, the efficacy of VNS varies, and its mechanism is unclear. Prior studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activations with VNS in human brains but yielded inconsistent findings. The source of the inconsistency might be attributed to the complex temporal characteristics of VNS evoked responses that cannot be fully explained by simplified response models.  \nObjective: We used fMRI to characterize the effects of VNS in rat brains without assuming any priori response model. The questions of primary interest were 1) whether and where the VNS evoked responses at the level of networks, and 2) whether and where the VNS altered the patterns of interactions among intrinsic functional networks. \nMethods: We performed 7 Tesla blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI on Sprague Dawley rats receiving simultaneous electrical stimulation at the left cervical vagus nerve. Using independent component analysis, we mapped the patterns of network activations and interactions in contrast to those in the resting state.\nResults: Left cervical VNS evoked widespread responses over ~76% of the brain volume with the most notable activations in the brainstem and hypothalamus. The VNS evoked complex and distinctive temporal responses at different brain networks and altered the patterns of interactions among networks, especially for the limbic system.\nConclusion: This paper reports a method for exploring the complex response of VNS in a data-driven manner.

To test visual cortical integration into working memory networks, we recorded magnetoencephalographic data from congenitally blind and sighted individuals during resting state as well as during a voice-based working memory task prior to and following working memory training with voices, or tactile stimuli or a training-control task. Auditory training strengthened beta-band (17.5-22.5 Hz) connectivity (imaginary coherency) in the blind and theta-band (2.5-5 Hz) connectivity in the sighted during the task, suggesting different neural coupling mechanisms. In the sighted, theta-band connectivity increased between brain areas involved in auditory working memory (inferior frontal, superior temporal, insular cortex). In the blind, beta-band networks largely emerged during the training, and connectivity increased between brain areas involved in auditory working memory and the visual cortex. The prominent involvement of the right fusiform face area in this beta-band network suggests a task-specific integration of visual cortex.

We find that the model predicts the functional form of the relationships extremely well, with coefficients of determination in excess of 0.95.  Moreover, the model predicts a phase transition at distance scales where sample plots are overlapping, which we confirm empirically.  Our framework and model provide a fundamental, quantitative link between distance-decay relationships and the shapes of ranges of taxa."},

Conventional cell lineages are reconstructed according to a cell division doctrine of one mother cell dividing into two daughter cells. An alternative cell lineage  reconstruction method followed a cell reproduction discovery of multiple daughter cells reproduced from a same mother cell. To see which reconstruction method reflects reality of early embryogenesis of Caenorhabditis elegans, a side-by-side comparison was made between two methods. Here I show cell division-based lineage distorted reality and failed in revealing any true genealogy. Cell reproduction-based lineage conformed to reality with exact same number of cells in every developmental stage under examination and showed clear genealogical relationship. A paradigm-shift from cell division- to cell reproduction-based cell lineage analysis is necessary for correct understanding of developmental biology and will lead to a revolution in cell biology and life science."},

To uncover the metabolic basis underlying the prolonged shelf life, we compared four Penjar accessions to Ailsa Craig (AC). Three accessions bore alcobaca mutation, whereas fourth was a novel NAC-NOR allele with only six amino acids in the encoded protein. The cuticle composition among Penjars varied widely during the progression of fruit ripening. All Penjars exhibited delayed ripening, prolonged on-vine and off-vine shelf life, low ethylene emission and carotenoid levels albeit with accession-specific differences. Metabolic profiling revealed shifts in Krebs cycle intermediates, amino acids, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid levels indicating the attenuation of respiration in Penjars during post-harvest storage. The prolonged shelf life of Penjar fruits was associated with a concerted downregulation of a number of cell-wall modifying genes and cell-wall-related metabolites. The accumulation of higher ABA and sucrose levels at the onset of senescence in Penjar fruits likely contribute to reduced water loss. Our analyses reveal that in addition to specialized cuticle composition, the attenuation of various metabolic processes by NAC-NOR mutation likely prolongs the shelf life of Penjar fruits."},

Using quantitative microscopy, grafting experiments and genetic perturbations, we connect the plant environment to the SAM, by describing the molecular mechanism by which cytokinins signal the level of nutrient availability to the SAM. We show that a systemic signal of cytokinin precursors[3] mediates the adaptation of SAM size and organogenesis rate to the availability of mineral nutrients by modulating the expression of WUSCHEL, a key regulator of stem cell homeostasis[4]. In time-lapse experiments, we further show that this mechanism allows meristems to adapt to rapid changes in nitrate concentration, and thereby modulate their rate of organ production to the availability of mineral nutrients within a few days. Our work sheds new light on the role of the stem cell regulatory network, by showing that it does not only maintain meristem homeostasis but also allows plants to adapt to rapid changes in the environment."},

Therefore, the leak of membership information is a major privacy risk. Genomic beacons aim to provide a secure, easy to implement, and standardized interface for data sharing by only allowing yes/no queries on the presence of specific alleles in the dataset. Previously deemed secure against re-identification attacks, beacons were shown to be vulnerable despite their stringent policy. Recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to determine whether the victim is in the dataset, by repeatedly querying the beacon for his/her single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this work, we propose a novel re-identification attack and show that the privacy risk is more serious than previously thought. Using the proposed attack, even if the victim systematically hides informative SNPs (i.e., SNPs with very low minor allele frequency -MAF-), it is possible to infer the alleles at positions of interest as well as the beacon query results with very high confidence. Our method is based on the fact that alleles at different loci are not necessarily independent. We use the linkage disequilibrium and a high-order Markov chain-based algorithm for the inference. We show that in a simulated beacon with 65 individuals from the CEU population, we can infer membership of individuals with 95% confidence with only 5 queries, even when SNPs with MAF less than 0.05 are hidden. This means, we need less than 0.5% of the number of queries that existing works require, to determine beacon membership under the same conditions. We further show that countermeasures such as hiding certain parts of the genome or setting a query budget for the user would fail to protect the privacy of the participants under our adversary model."},

This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they may have controlled effects on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of powerful parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a system's (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight the capability of the methods to pinpoint key elements related to cell function and cell development, conforming with biological knowledge and experimentally validated data, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a system's dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms."},

The availability of a wide range of measures for ranking influential nodes leaves the user to decide which measure may best suit the analysis of a given network. The choice of a suitable measure is furthermore complicated by the impact of the network topology on ranking influential nodes by centrality measures. To approach this problem systematically, we examined the centrality profile of nodes of yeast protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) in order to detect which centrality measure is succeeding in predicting influential proteins. We studied how different topological network features are reflected in a large set of commonly used centrality measures.\nResults: We used yeast PPINs to compare 27 common of centrality measures. The measures characterize and assort influential nodes of the networks. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering and found that the most informative measures depend on the network's topology. Interestingly, some measures had a high level of contribution in comparison to others in all PPINs, namely Latora closeness, Decay, Lin, Freeman closeness, Diffusion, Residual closeness and Average distance centralities. \nConclusions: The choice of a suitable set of centrality measures is crucial for inferring important functional properties of a network. We concluded that undertaking data reduction using unsupervised machine learning methods helps to choose appropriate variables (centrality measures). Hence, we proposed identifying the contribution proportions of the centrality measures with PCA as a prerequisite step of network analysis before inferring functional consequences, e.g., essentiality of a node."},

Central to building and reorganizing cytoskeletal arrays is the creation of new polymers. While nucleation has been the major focus of study for microtubule creation, it has been proposed that severing might also be used to create new populations of microtubules. This generative capacity of severing was recently demonstrated directly in higher plants, where it was shown that severing by katanin drives the reorientation of cortical microtubule arrays by amplifying a new population of polymers as part of the phototrophic response. An important and unanswered question about how severing can lead to the creation of new microtubule arrays is how the freshly severed ends are stabilized such that severing does not lead instead to array dissolution. Here we identify the conserved protein CLASP as a potent in vivo stabilizer of new plus ends generated by katanin mediated severing in Arabidopsis. This activity was required for rapid cortical array reorientation in response to light signaling. CLASP was found to increase the fraction of plus ends rescued after severing by approximately 4.3-fold, an increase shown by computational modeling to likely be a key factor for amplifying new populations of microtubules created by severing to reorganize cortical microtubule arrays."},

Such hormone-mediated changes might serve to (1) avoid inbreeding during peak fertility and/or (2) increase kin affiliation during pregnancy. The first hypothesis predicts that responses to kinship cues will be most negative during hormonal states characteristic of high fertility (i.e., when estradiol-to-progesterone ratio is high). The second hypothesis predicts that responses to kinship cues will be most positive during hormonal states characteristic of pregnancy (i.e., when progesterone is high). We used a longitudinal design (N = 176) to investigate possible relationships between women\u2032s responses to self-resembling faces and their measured salivary hormone levels. Women\u2032s preferences for self-resembling male faces were not related to estradiol-to-progesterone ratio. However, preferences for self-resembling female faces were positively related to progesterone (and negatively to estradiol). These findings do not support the inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis, but do support the proposal that women\u2032s hormonal status influences attitudes to kin because of benefits associated with increased kin affiliation during pregnancy."},

We evaluated the association between egocentric and allocentric neglect, contrasted the prevalence and severity of left-sided versus right-sided neglect, and determined the predictors of persistence versus recovery at follow up.

Importantly, patients with only allocentric neglect did not demonstrate any egocentric spatial bias in the locations of the allocentric errors. Left-sided egocentric neglect was more prevalent and more severe than right-sided egocentric neglect, though right-sided neglect was still highly prevalent in the acute stroke sample (35%). Left-sided allocentric neglect was more severe but not more prevalent than right-sided allocentric neglect.

To transcribe these viral genome segments, the RdRp 'snatches' capped RNA oligonucleotides from nascent host cell mRNAs and aligns these primers to the ultimate or penultimate nucleotide of the segments for the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. It has been proposed that this initiation process is not processive and that the RdRp uses a prime-realign mechanism during transcription. Here we provide in vitro evidence for the existence of this transcriptional prime-realign mechanism, but show that it only functions efficiently for primers that are not stably base paired with the template. In addition, we demonstrate that transcriptional elongation is dependent on the priming loop of the PB1 subunit of the RdRp. We propose that the prime-realign mechanism may be used to rescue abortive transcription initiation events or cope with sequence variation among primers. Overall, these observations advance our mechanistic understanding of how the influenza A virus initiates transcription correctly and efficiently."},

As with all genomics experiments, batch effects can hamper data integration and interpretation. The success of batch effect correction is often evaluated by visual inspection of dimension reduced representations such as principal component analysis. This is inherently imprecise due to the high number of genes and non-normal distribution of gene expression. Here, we present a k-nearest neighbour batch effect test (kBET, https://github.com/theislab/kBET) to quantitatively measure batch effects. kBET is easier to interpret, more sensitive and more robust than visual evaluation and other measures of batch effects. We use kBET to assess commonly used batch regression and normalisation approaches, and quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. Our results illustrate that batch correction based on log-transformation or scran pooling followed by ComBat reduced the batch effect while preserving structure across data sets. Finally we show that kBET can pinpoint successful data integration methods across multiple data sets, in this case from different publications all charting mouse embryonic development. This has important implications for future data integration efforts, which will be central to projects such as the Human Cell Atlas where data for the same tissue may be generated in multiple locations around the world."},

The IBM explicitly accounts for crowding effects by modifying the rate of movement, direction of movement, and the rate of proliferation by accounting for pair-wise interactions.  Taking a Bayesian approach we estimate the free parameters in the IBM using rejection sampling on three separate, independent experimental data sets.  Since the posterior distributions from each experiment are similar, we perform simulations with parameters sampled from the combined distribution to explore the predictive power of the calibrated IBM by accurately forecasting the evolution of a fourth, experimental data set.

However, the epigenomic basis of the long-lived consequences is not well understood. \nMethods: Here, we employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and a multiplex microRNA (miRNA) assay to examine the effects of augmented maternal care on DNA cytosine methylation, gene expression, and miRNA expression. \nResults: A significant decrease in global DNA methylation was observed in offspring hypothalamus following a week of augmented maternal care, corresponding to differential methylation and expression of thousands of genes. Differentially methylated and expressed genes were enriched for functions in neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, protein synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as known stress response genes. Twenty prioritized genes with three lines of evidence (methylation, expression, and altered miRNA target) were identified as highly relevant to the stress resiliency phenotype. \nConclusions: This combined unbiased approach enabled the discovery of novel genes and gene pathways that advance our understanding of the central epigenomic mechanisms underlying the profound effects of maternal care on the developing brain."},

Analysis of samples from NA12878 and HuRef suggests that complex SVs are often misclassified by traditional methods. We validated our results both experimentally and by comparison to whole genome assembly and PacBio data; ARC-SV compares favorably to existing algorithms in general and gives state-of-the-art results on complex SV detection.

{"title": "The GENIUS Approach to Robust Mendelian Randomization Inference", "authors": ["Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen", "BaoLuo Sun", "Stefan Walter"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/193953 ", "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) is a popular instrumental variable (IV) approach, in which one or several genetic markers serve as IVs that can be leveraged to recover under certain conditions, valid inferences about a given exposure-outcome causal association subject to unmeasured confounding. A key IV identification condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the IV has no direct effect on the outcome that is not mediated by the exposure in view. In MR studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic level of knowledge and understanding of the mechanism by which the genetic markers causally affect the outcome, particularly when a large number of genetic variants are considered as IVs. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion restriction can seldom be ruled out in such MR studies, and if present, such violation can invalidate IV-based inferences even if unbeknownst to the analyst, confounding is either negligible or absent. To address this concern, we introduce a new class of IV estimators which are robust to violation of the exclusion restriction under a large collection of data generating mechanisms consistent with parametric models commonly assumed in the MR literature. Our approach which we have named \"MR G-Estimation under No Interaction with Unmeasured Selection\" (MR GENIUS) may in fact be viewed as a modification to Robins' G-estimation approach that is robust to both additive unmeasured confounding and violation of the exclusion restriction assumption. We also establish that estimation with MR GENIUS may also be viewed as a robust generalization of the well-known Lewbel estimator for a triangular system of structural equations with endogeneity. Specifically, we show that unlike Lewbel estimation, MR GENIUS is under fairly weak conditions also robust to unmeasured confounding of the effects of the genetic IVs on both the exposure and the outcome, another possible violation of a key IV Identification condition. Furthermore, while Lewbel estimation involves specification of linear models both for the outcome and the exposure, MR GENIUS generally does not require specification of a structural model for the direct effect of invalid IVs on the outcome, therefore allowing the latter model to be unrestricted. Finally, unlike Lewbel estimation, MR GENIUS is shown to equally apply for binary, discrete or continuous exposure and outcome variables and can be used under prospective sampling, or retrospective sampling such as in a case-control study, as well as for right censored time-to-event outcomes under an additive hazards model."},

Individuals of royal and noble ancestry or high social economic status (SES) are known to practice assortative mating and consanguineous marriages, which can produce offspring of both higher and lower than average fitness. However, the roles of the super-grandfather Y haplotypes and their descendant lines in history, fitness, and the male biased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unknown. Here we show a link between the super-grandfathers and the legend of Yan-Huang Emperors and between their descendant haplotypes and ASD. We found that subjects carrying the O3a1c and O3a2c1a super-grandfather haplotypes were enriched with Yan and Huang related surnames, respectively, in two independent datasets of 1564 and 772 male Han subjects. We identified high and low SES descendant haplotypes of the super-grandfathers using the Han dataset of the 1000 genomes project based on two criteria: more descendant branches and fewer mutations before star-like expansions. By genotyping 505 fathers of ASD affected male children from the Autism Clinical and Genetic Resources in China with surnames either closely related to Huang (Ying group) or less related (Ji group), we found the high SES haplotypes within the O3a2c1a clade at ~2 fold lower (odds ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.28-3.26, P=0.0026) while the low SES haplotypes at ~2 fold higher frequency (odds ratio 1.92, 95% CI 1.01-3.64, P = 0.046) in the fathers relative to 505 normal subjects. The fraction of low SES haplotypes was greater than that of high SES in ASD fathers of the Ying group, in contrast to Ying controls or the Ji fathers and Ji controls. Consistently, analysis of 2366 ASD affected children showed higher male to female ratio for Ying versus Ji group (6.52 +/-1.11 v 4.59 +/-0.41, P = 0.028, one tailed).

Cyclical worsening of symptoms was evaluated using (1) phase contrasts in multilevel models and (2) the Carolina Premenstrual Assessment Scoring System (C-PASS), a standardized tool for evaluating clinically significant cycle effects on symptoms.\nResults. Despite low retrospective perceptions of perimenstrual symptom change, all symptoms showed marked perimenstrual worsening in prospective ratings, with secondary worsening of certain symptoms in the midluteal and follicular phases. The ovulatory phase was associated with the lowest symptoms. 11 of 15 females met C-PASS criteria for significant premenstrual symptom worsening. \nConclusions. Females with BPD may be at elevated risk for perimenstrual worsening of emotional symptoms. Experimental work is needed to determine the pathophysiology of perimenstrual exacerbation in BPD."},

Many classes of mutations led to large-effect splicing disruptions including mutations far from canonical splice sites, and these effects were not easily predicted. We assayed 29,531 extant variants in the Exome Aggregation Consortium, and found that >1000 variants (3.6%) within or adjacent to 2393 assayed human exons led to almost complete loss of exon recognition. While most variants at the canonical splice site disrupt splicing, they represent <20% of splice-disrupting variants overall because genetic variation elsewhere dominates.

Appropriate levels of ergosterol is crucial for resistance to various stressful conditions, such as hypoxia, hypothermia, and hyperosmolarity. The isoprenoid building blocks of ergosterol is synthesized via the mevalonate pathway and relies on the availability of many central metabolites, such as acetyl-coA and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), that are also the substrates for epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation and methylation. To have a better understanding of how isoprenoid synthesis and these epigenetic mechanisms affect each other, we re-analyzed our screen results of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion collection for isoprenoid production and found a group of chromatin regulators with significant effects on isoprenoid production. More specifically, the canonical histone Htz1 (H2A.z), the SWR1 complex that loads Htz1 onto chromatin, and the histone demethylase Jhd2 inhibited, whereas the Htz1 unloading INO80 complex and histone methylase Set1 enhanced isoprenoid production. Further analysis of genome-wide expression data revealed that Htz1 and Set1 differentially regulates stress-response genes which presumably affect isoprenoid synthesis. Conversely, changes in isoprenoid production alters the transcription of the same set of genes. Further analysis of these gene deletions for ergosterol levels showed that deleting both Htz1 and Set1 leads to accumulation of ergosterol beyond homeostatic levels and renders cells vulnerable to environmental stress. Our re-analysis of multiple published data and follow-up experiments revealed an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism between ergosterol levels and stress response genes that is essential for maintaining optimum concentration of ergosterol under various conditions."},

In reconstruction of the evolutionary processes underlying diversification and morphological innovation among eukaryotes, Diphyllatea plays a key role together with other orphan lineages. Despite being of evolutionary significance, only three species of Diphyllatea have descripted morphology, with molecular data available from fewer. The lack of data means that the actual diversity of this key lineage of eukaryotes remains unresolved. We here present a first attempt to understand the species diversity and higher order structure of the Diphyllatea phylogeny. We have cultured several new strains, described these morphologically, and amplified their rRNA. We have sampled DNA from multiple globally distributed sites, using these as templates in a Diphyllatea-specific PCR. In contrast to recent diversity studies, which use short variable gene regions, we amplify nearly the whole 18S rRNA gene, and sequence using PacBio RS II technology, to provide enough information to resolve historically ancient speciation events. Phylogenetic inference of Diphyllatea rRNA reveals three deeply branching and distinct clades of Diphyllatea, here named Diphy I, II and III. Diphy I and II include the genera Diphylleia and Collodictyon. Notably, Diphy III is here shown as novel phylogenetic clade with all strains investigated having a congruent morphology to Collodictyon triciliatum (Diphy II). Altogether, Diphyllatea seems to constitute two morphotypes, a biflagellate (i.e. Diphy I) and a quadraflagellate (i.e. Diphy II and III) form, congruent with earlier descriptions of Diphylleia and Collodictyon. Further, our targeted environmental sequencing approach, which includes specific PCR primers, reveals a wider global distribution of Diphyllatea than earlier known. Altogether, the described protocol shows the usefulness of combining long amplicon high-throughput sequencing and lineage-specific PCR approach in surveys of enigmatic eukaryote lineages."},

This assay allows assessing a much broader range of misincorporation events compared to current, very sensitive but also very specific enzyme reporter assays. Our assay uncovers a remarkably rich pool of error products for a model protein expressed in E. coli, which depend quantitatively on codon usage in the expression construct. This codon usage dependence can be explained in part as a function of the composition of the tRNA pool in this organism. We further show that codon-dependent differences in error levels correlate with measurable changes in specific protein activity. In contrast to E. coli, error levels are lower, and appear not to be codon usage dependent, when the same model protein is expressed in S. cerevisiae."},

We evaluated how pathogen concentration in urine affects microfluidic AST using a novel microplate-compatible high-throughput microfluidic AST system termed Lab on a Comb. When tested with clinical E. coli isolates at standardised density, these devices gave identical antibiotic susceptibility profiles to standard disc diffusion and microtitre plate tests. Bacterial detection directly in synthetic urine spiked with clinical E. coli UTI isolates was possible over a very large dynamic range of starting cell densities, from 103 to 108 CFU/mL which covers the range of pathogen cell densities found in patient urine. The lowest cell density where cell growth was reproducibly detected was 9.6x102 CFU/mL, suggesting that one single CFU can be detected in a 1uL microcapillary. Cell growth kinetics followed a simple model with fast growth and a doubling time of 24min, indicating optimal growth conditions within these microfluidic devices. Susceptibility vs resistance to antibiotic took longer to detect for lower cell densities. At high pathogen density, metabolic activity was detected in the presence of some antibiotics even with a susceptible organism, raising the possibility of false-positive resistance from clinical samples containing high pathogen density."},

Experimentally perturbing the spatial distribution of Vipp1 by relocalizing it to the nucleoid causes a severe growth defect during the transition from non-photosynthetic (dark) to photosynthetic (light) growth. However, the same perturbation of Vipp1 in dark alone or light alone growth conditions causes no growth or thylakoid morphology defects. We propose that the punctuated dynamics of Vipp1 at the cell periphery in regions of high thylakoid curvature enable acquisition of photosynthetic competency, perhaps by facilitating biogenesis of photosynthetic complexes involved in light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis."},

Moreover, cortex exhibits a transcriptional architecture characterized by distinct profiles of gene expression across areas, yet organizing principles for areal transcriptomic specialization remain unclear. We hypothesized that functional specialization of human cortical microcircuitry across areas involves hierarchical gradients of gene expression. Here we show that a noninvasive neuroimaging measure, the MRI-derived myelin map, indexes the anatomical hierarchy and closely resembles the dominant areal pattern of transcriptomic variation across the human cortex. We found strong hierarchical gradients in expression of genes related to cortical microcircuit function, which we validated with microanatomical data from monkey cortex, and in expression of genes related to neuropsychiatric disorders. These findings establish hierarchy as a general organizing principle, defining an axis shared by the transcriptomic and anatomical architectures of human cortex, and suggest that hierarchical gradients of microscale properties shape the macroscale specialization of cortical function."},

The sky islands in southwestern China are characterized by extraordinarily high species diversity and are among one of the world's top biodiversity hotspots. However, neither the actual species diversity in this region or mechanisms generating this diversity are well explored. Here, we report on the phylogeographic analysis of the long-tailed mole (Scaptonyx fusicaudus), a semi-fossorial mammal that inhabits the montane cool forests across the Chinese sky islands and is considered to represent one species divided into two subspecies. Analyses using DNA sequence data from one mitochondrial and six nuclear genes revealed that populations inhabiting different mountains exhibited exceptionally strong geographic structure. The lowlands and large rivers act as \"soft\" and \"hard\" barriers to dispersal, respectively, isolating evolutionary lineages for up to 11 million years. Our results suggest that the mountain ranges act as interglacial refugia buffering populations from climate fluctuations, further facilitating allopatric diversification. Strikingly, species delimitation analyses suggests that the long-tailed mole may comprise 18 operational taxonomic units and 17 putative species. Our results suggest that for low-vagility species, the complex topography of the Chinese sky islands has shaped genetic diversity and structure and promoted exceptional diversification through a combination of eco-environmental stability as well as geographic fragmentation. The patterns observed in S. fusicaudus may be representative for other cold-adapted species, reflecting the generation of mammalian faunal diversity in the sky-island mountains of southwestern China."},

The computational model suggested a family of inhibitors, the imidazopyridine aminofurazans (IPAs), bind PknB with high affinity. We found that these inhibitors biochemically inhibit PknB, with potency roughly following the predicted models. A novel x-ray structure confirmed that the inhibitors bind as predicted and made favorable protein contacts with the target. These inhibitors also have antimicrobial activity towards Mycobacteria and Nocardia, and normally ineffective \u03b2-lactams can potentiate IPAs to more efficiently inhibit growth of these pathogens.

Gstm1 silencing in astrocytes also attenuated LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 production by microglia in co-culture.

Similar results were also obtained with GSTT2 both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study identified a critical role for GSTs in priming astrocytes and enhancing microglia activation during brain inflammation."},

Nguyen Ba", "Alan M. Moses"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/199653 ", "abstract": "The effort to characterize intrinsically disordered regions of signaling proteins is rapidly expanding. An important class of disordered interaction modules are ubiquitous and functionally diverse elements known as short linear motifs (SLiMs). We used a previously devised bioinformatics method to predict evolutionarily conserved SLiMs within a well-characterized pathway in S. cerevisiae. Using a single cell, flow cytometry assay with a pathway-specific promoter, we quantitatively assessed pathway output via systematic deletions of individual motifs. We found that, when deleted, 34% (10/29) of predicted SLiMs displayed a significant decrease in pathway output, providing evidence that these motifs play a role in signal transduction. In addition, we show that perturbations of parameters in a previously published stochastic model of HOG signaling could reproduce the quantitative effects of 4 out of 7 mutations in previously unknown SLiMs. Our study suggests that, even in well-characterized pathways, large numbers of functional elements remain undiscovered, and that challenges remain for application of systems biology models to interpret the effects of mutations in signalling pathways."},

The resulting small genomes often become unusually stable in size, structure, and coding capacity. Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola (Hodgkinia), a bacterial endosymbiont of cicadas, sometimes exemplifies this genomic stability. The Hodgkinia genome has remained completely co-linear in some cicadas diverged by tens of millions of years. But in the long-lived periodical cicada Magicicada tredecim, the Hodgkinia genome has split into dozens of tiny, gene-sparse genomic circles that sometimes reside in distinct Hodgkinia cells. Previous data suggested that other Magicicada species harbor similarly complex Hodgkinia populations, but the timing, number of origins, and outcomes of the splitting process were unknown. Here, by sequencing Hodgkinia metagenomes from the remaining six Magicicada species and two sister species, we show that all Magicicada species harbor Hodgkinia populations of at least twenty genomic circles each. We find little synteny among the 256 Hodgkinia circles analyzed except between the most closely related species. Individual gene phylogenies show that Hodgkinia first split in the common ancestor of Magicicada and its closest known relatives, but that most splitting has occurred within Magicicada and has given rise to highly variable Hodgkinia gene dosages between cicada species. These data show that Hodgkinia genome degradation has proceeded down different paths in different Magicicada species, and support a model of genomic degradation that is stochastic in outcome and likely nonadaptive for the host. These patterns mirror the genomic instability seen in some mitochondria."},

Here, we test the fundamental role of midbrain dopamine neurons in conferring predictive or motivational properties to cues, independent of external rewards. We demonstrate that phasic optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons throughout the midbrain, when presented in temporal association with discrete sensory cues, is sufficient to instantiate those cues as conditioned stimuli that subsequently both evoke dopamine neuron activity on their own, and elicit cue-locked conditioned behaviors. Critically, we identify highly parcellated behavioral functions for dopamine neuron subpopulations projecting to discrete regions of striatum, revealing dissociable mesostriatal systems for the generation of incentive value and movement invigoration. These results show that dopamine neurons orchestrate Pavlovian conditioning via functionally heterogeneous, circuit-specific motivational signals to shape cue-controlled behavior."},

Here we show that coinciding with eye opening, the strength of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) from somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) to nearby excitatory neurons, but not interneurons, sharply decreases in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex. In contrast, the strength of uIPSCs from fast-spiking interneurons (FS-INs) to excitatory neurons significantly increases during eye opening. More importantly, these developmental changes can be prevented by dark rearing or binocular lid suture, and reproduced by artificial opening of sutured lids. Mechanistically, this differential maturation of synaptic transmission is accompanied by a significant change in the postsynaptic quantal size. Together, our study reveals a differential regulation in GABAergic circuits in the cortex driven by eye opening likely crucial for cortical maturation and function."},

For example, predicted heights correlate ~0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few cm of the prediction. The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve the common SNP portion of the \"missing heritability\" problem - i.e., the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The ~20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes.

We investigated whether these observational associations are the result of genetic risk factors influencing both caffeine consumption and poorer sleep, and/or whether they reflect (possibly bidirectional) causal effects.  Methods: Summary-level data were available from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on caffeine consumption (n=91,462), sleep duration, and chronotype (i.e., being a morning versus an evening person) (both n=128,266), and insomnia complaints (n=113,006). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression was used to calculate genetic correlations, reflecting the extent to which genetic variants influencing caffeine consumption and sleep behaviours overlap. Causal effects were tested with bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), an instrumental variable approach that utilizes genetic variants robustly associated with an exposure variable as an instrument to test causal effects. Estimates from individual genetic variants were combined using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, weighted median regression and MR Egger regression methods.  Results: There was no clear evidence for genetic correlation between caffeine consumption and sleep duration (rg=0.000, p=0.998), chronotype (rg=0.086, p=0.192) or insomnia (rg=-0.034, p=0.700). Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses did not support causal effects from caffeine consumption to sleep behaviours, or the other way around.  Conclusions: We found no evidence in support of genetic correlation or causal effects between caffeine consumption and sleep. While caffeine may have acute effects on sleep when taken shortly before habitual bedtime, our findings suggest that a more sustained pattern of high caffeine consumption is likely associated with poorer sleep through shared environmental factors."},

Recent theories have proposed that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) regulates control levels by weighing the reward-related benefits of control against its effort-related costs. However, given that the sensations of cognitive effort and reward valuation are available only to introspection, this hypothesis is difficult to investigate empirically. We have proposed that two electrophysiological indices of ACC function, frontal midline theta and the reward positivity (RewP), provide objective measures of these functions. To investigate this issue, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from participants engaged in an extended, cognitively-demanding task. Participants performed a time estimation task for 2 hours in which they received reward and error feedback according to their task performance. We observed that the amplitude of the RewP, a feedback-locked component of the event related brain potential associated with reward processing, decreased with time-on-task. Conversely, frontal midline theta power, which consists of 4-8 Hz EEG oscillations associated with cognitive effort, increased with time-on-task. We also examined how these phenomena changed over time by conducting within-participant multi-level modeling analyses. Our results suggest that extended execution of a cognitively-demanding task is characterized by an early phase in which high control levels combine with strong reward valuation to foster rapid improvements in task performance, and a later phase in which high control levels counteract waning reward valuation to maintain stable task performance."},

Here, we investigate this question by focusing on physiological evolution along the thermal niche axis in replicated radiations of Anolis lizards, groups that are best known for resource partitioning based on morphological evolution. We find repeated divergence in thermal physiology within these radiations, and that this divergence has performance consequences within natural habitats. In addition, morphologically similar species that co-occur invariably differ in their thermal physiology, providing evidence that physiological divergence facilitates species co-existence within these communities. Despite their ecological importance, phylogenetic comparative analyses suggest that thermal niche traits have evolved more slowly than key morphological traits related to the structural niche. Phylogenetic analyses also reveal that physiological (i.e., fundamental) thermal niche evolution is correlated with realized thermal niche evolution based on geo-referenced locality data, but the latter incompletely predicts variation in the former. We provide comprehensive evidence for the importance of physiological divergence within Anolis adaptive radiations, including the complementary roles of physiological and morphological divergence in maintaining community-level diversity. We recommend greater integration of fundamental niche traits into analyses of climatic niche evolution, as they facilitate a more complete understanding of the phenotypic and ecological consequences of climatic divergence."},

To understand the relationship, we conducted predation experiments in outdoor tanks and a semi-natural stream with exposure to local predators. Two different ranges of fork lengths of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) were examined as prey sizes. Camera trap data showed that grey herons (Ardea cinerea) were the primary predator animal in the system, and that most herons utilized shallow areas in the morning or evening. Increasing the density of stocked salmon brought in more grey herons. More importantly, predation by grey herons resulted in the survival rate of larger salmon being significantly lower than that of the smaller salmon. Our results suggest that it is important to understand local predators, adjust the optimum body size of hatchery fish at release, and choose the appropriate stocking site and time of day for maximizing the effectiveness of fish stocking."},

The ability to explore human kinase biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology in the laboratory is essential to making rapid progress in understanding kinase regulation, designing selective inhibitors, and studying the emergence of drug resistance. While insect and mammalian expression systems are frequently used for the expression of human kinases, bacterial expression systems are superior in terms of simplicity and cost-effectiveness but have historically struggled with human kinase expression. Following the discovery that phosphatase coexpression could produce high yields of Src and Abl kinase domains in bacterial expression systems, we have generated a library of 52 His-tagged human kinase domain constructs that express above 2 ug/mL culture in a simple automated bacterial expression system utilizing phosphatase coexpression (YopH for Tyr kinases, Lambda for Ser/Thr kinases).  Here, we report a structural bioinformatics approach to identify kinase domain constructs likely to express in bacteria, experiments demonstrating our simple construct selection strategy selects constructs with good expression yields in a test of 84 potential kinase domain boundaries for Abl, and yields from a high-throughput expression screen of 96 human kinase constructs. We also demonstrate how the resulting expressing constructs can be used for the biophysical and biochemical study of clinical mutations by engineering a panel of 48 Src mutations and 46 Abl mutations via single-primer mutagenesis and screening the resulting library for expression yields. The wild-type kinase construct library is available publicly via addgene, and should prove to be of high utility for experiments focused on drug discovery and the emergence of drug resistance."},

To determine whether late heterochronic shifts underlie derived floral morphologies within Jaltomata (Solanaceae) - a genus whose species have extensive and recently evolved floral diversity - we compared floral development of four diverse species (including an ambiguously ancestral or secondarily derived rotate, two putatively independently evolved campanulate, and a tubular morph) to the ancestral rotate floral form, as well as to an outgroup that shares this ancestral floral morphology.\n\nResults: We determined that early floral development (<1 mm bud diameter, corresponding to completion of organ whorl initiation) is very similar among all species, but that different mature floral forms are distinguishable by mid-development (>1 mm diameters) due to differential growth acceleration of corolla traits. Floral ontogeny among similar mature rotate forms remains comparable until late stages, while somewhat different patterns of organ growth are found between species with similar campanulate forms. \n\nConclusions: Our data suggest shared floral patterning during early-stage development, but that different heterochronic shifts during mid- and late-stage development contributes to divergent floral traits. Heterochrony thus appears to have been important in the rapid and repeated diversification of Jaltomata flowers."},

The urine proteomes of 27 normal samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS and compared among the three regions. We identified 1,898 proteins from Urimem samples using label-free proteome quantification, of which 62 urine proteins were differentially expressed among the three regions. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that inter-regional differences caused less significant changes in the urine proteome than inter-sex differences. Of the 62 differentially expressed proteins, 10 have been reported to be disease biomarkers in previous clinical studies. Urimem facilitates urinary protein storage for large-scale urine sample collection, and thus accelerates biobank development and urine biomarker studies employing proteomics approaches. Regional differences are a confounding factor influencing the urine proteome and should be considered in future multi-center biomarker studies."},

Understanding how to report complex genomic test results to stakeholders who may have varying familiarity with genomics - including clinicians, laboratorians, epidemiologists, and researchers - is critical to the successful and sustainable implementation of this new technology; however, there are no evidence-based guidelines for designing such a report in the pathogen genomics domain. Here, we describe an iterative, human-centered approach to creating a report template for communicating tuberculosis (TB) genomic test results.  Methods: We used Design Study Methodology - a human centered multi-stage approach drawn from the information visualization domain - to redesign an existing clinical report. We used expert consults and an online questionnaire to discover various stakeholders' needs around the types of data and tasks related to TB that they encounter in their daily workflow. We also evaluated their perceptions of and familiarity with genomic data, as well as its utility at various clinical decision points. These data shaped the design of multiple prototype reports that were compared against the existing report through a second online survey, with the resulting qualitative and quantitative data informing the final, redesigned, report.  Results: We recruited 78 participants, 65 of whom were clinicians, nurses, laboratorians, researchers, and epidemiologists involved in TB diagnosis, treatment, and/or surveillance. Our first survey indicated that participants were largely enthusiastic about genomic data, with the majority agreeing on its utility for certain TB diagnosis and treatment tasks and many reporting some confidence in their ability to interpret this type of data (between 58.8% and 94.1%, depending on the specific data type). When we compared our four prototype reports against the existing design, we found that for the majority (86.7%) of design comparisons, participants preferred the alternative prototype designs over the existing version, and that both clinicians and non-clinicians expressed similar design preferences. Participants articulated clearer design preferences when asked to compare individual design elements versus entire reports. Both the quantitative and qualitative data informed the design of a revised report, which is available online as a LaTeX template.  Conclusion:  We show how a human-centered design approach integrating quantitative and qualitative feedback can be used to design an alternative report for representing complex microbial genomic data. We suggest experimental and design guidelines to inform future design studies in the bioinformatics and microbial genomics domains, and suggest that this type of mixed-methods study is important to facilitate the successful translation of pathogen genomics in the clinic, not only for clinical reports but also more complex bioinformatics data visualization software."},

We used a visuomotor delay to induce cross-modal variations in state feedback and uncovered that the difference between visual and proprioceptive velocity estimations at isolated collision events was compensated by a change in the representation of arm inertia. The compensation maintained an invariant estimate across modalities of the expected energy exchange with the environment. This invariance captures different types of dysmetria observed across individuals following prolonged exposure to a fixed intermodal temporal perturbation and provides a new interpretation for cerebellar ataxia."},

Consequently, the inherent stochasticity of binding and diffusion processes generate noise along the cascade that leads to the synthesis of a protein from its encoding gene. As a result, isogenic cell populations display phenotypic variability even in homogeneous environments. The extent and consequences of this stochastic gene expression have only recently been assessed on a genome-wide scale, in particular owing to the advent of single cell transcriptomics. However, the evolutionary forces shaping this stochasticity have yet to be unraveled. We took advantage of two recently published data sets of the single-cell transcriptome of the domestic mouse Mus musculus in order to characterize the effect of natural selection on gene-specific transcriptional stochasticity. We showed that noise levels in the mRNA distributions (a.k.a. transcriptional noise) significantly correlate with three-dimensional nuclear domain organization, evolutionary constraint on the encoded protein and gene age. The position of the encoded protein in biological pathways, however, is the main factor that explains observed levels of transcriptional noise, in agreement with models of noise propagation within gene networks. Because transcriptional noise is under widespread selection, we argue that it constitutes an important component of the phenotype and that variance of expression is a potential target of adaptation. Stochastic gene expression should therefore be considered together with mean expression level in functional and evolutionary studies of gene expression."},

Estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER) and glucocorticoid receptor(GR) are co-expressed in the uterus and their ligands have opposing effects on uterine growth and morphology, with estrogens inducing growth and corticosteroids inhibiting growth. In endometrioid-type endometrial tumors expressing ER, we surprisingly found that the expression of GR is associated with poor prognosis and higher tumor grade. Dexamethasone reduced normal uterine growth in vivo; however, this growth inhibition was abolished once estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia was established and cancer cells increased growth when treated with dexamethasone and estradiol. To understand the underlying molecular crosstalk between ER and GR in endometrial cancer cells, we measured their genomic binding following treatment with estradiol, dexamethasone, and the combination. We found 20% overlap in bound loci when ER and GR are induced with their respective ligands individually; however, upon induction with both ligands simultaneously they co-occupy significantly more sites (47%). ER binding is only slightly affected by the presence of dexamethasone, while GR binding is significantly altered by the presence of estradiol with GR being recruited to loci bound by ER that contain estrogen response elements. The GR sites gained in the presence of estradiol consist of loci that become more accessible upon estradiol induction, supporting a model where ER assists in the chromatin loading of GR. The crosstalk in genomic binding is associated with gene expression changes upon co-treatment being more similar to estradiol than dexamethasone, but with novel regulated genes including a decrease in cell-cell adherens junction genes. Our results suggest both a phenotypic and molecular interplay between ER and GR in endometrial cancer."},

Three types of G to A substitutions were introduced 33, 35, and 36 base pairs downstream of the TATA box in the murine kAE1 promoter region by inverse PCR (Var1, Var2, and Var3, respectively). The HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors. After 24 hours, the firefly luciferase activity was determined.  Results and Discussion: The promoter activity of Var1, as well as that of Var2 to a lesser extent, was reduced compared with that of the wild-type. The introduction of variations such as Var1 and Var2 into the murine genome by genome editing may help to establish mouse models of incomplete dRTA."},

In Arabidopsis, phloem loading is mediated by a combination of SWEET sucrose effluxers and subsequent uptake by SUT1/SUC2 sucrose/H+ symporters. ZmSUT1 is essential for carbon allocation in maize, but the relative contribution to apoplasmic phloem loading and retrieval of sucrose leaking from the translocation path is not known. We therefor tested whether SWEETs are important for phloem loading in maize. Here we identified three leaf-expressed SWEET sucrose transporters as key components of apoplasmic phloem loading in Zea mays L. Notably, ZmSWEET13 paralogs (a, b, c) are among the highest expressed genes in the leaf vasculature. Genome-edited triple knock-out mutants are severely stunted. Photosynthesis of mutants was impaired and leaves accumulated starch and soluble sugars. RNA-seq revealed profound transcriptional deregulation of genes associated with the photosynthetic apparatus and carbohydrate metabolism. GWAS analyses may indicate that variability in ZmSWEET13s is correlated with agronomical traits, specifically flowering time and leaf angle. This work provides support for cooperation of three ZmSWEET13s with ZmSUT1 in phloem loading in Zea mays L. Our study highlights these three ZmSWEET13 sucrose transporters as possible candidates for the engineering of crop yield."},

TFs are central to organismal development, and morphology; therefore, they potentially are instrumental in producing phenotypic diversity. We measured TF abundance of 49 major TF DBD families in 48 bird genomes, which we then compared with 5 reptile genomes, in an effort to assess the degree to which TF DBD are potentially connected to increased phenotypic diversity in the avian lineage. We hypothesized that there would be increased TF DBD abundance in multiple TF families correlated with the increased phenotypic diversity found in birds; instead ultimately, we see a general loss of major TF DBD families, reflecting general genome reductions seen between reptiles and birds, with largest losses in TF DBD families associated with multiple developmental (feather, sex-determination, body-plan, immune, blood) and metabolic processes."},

In this study, we assessed the therapeutic value of this consensus recommendation, in the absence of gene expression data, as a tool for providing opportune and precise care.  Methods and Findings: In this retrospective hospital-based cohort study, we reviewed medical records of all suspected breast cancer patients in 2014 treated at the General Regional Hospital No. 1, of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), located in Charo, Michoacan (western Mexico). Then, we followed the medical history of those patients with IHC testing until March 2017. The trajectory of patients was recorded to discover common patterns, and turnaround time for IHC testing. There were 402 suspected breast cancer patients in 2014, of which 30 had been tested for some IHC biomarkers (ER, PR, HER2). The surrogate subtyping allowed doctors to adjust (56.7 %) or confirm (43.3 %) the initial therapeutic regimen. Opportune IHC testing was found to be beneficial when it was available before or during the first rounds of chemotherapy.  Conclusions: The use of opportune immunohistochemistry provides improved outcomes for breast cancer patients. This result has the potential to become a roadmap for the implementation of precision medicine in Mexico."},

Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division in Bangladesh. In particular we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination control policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, targeted proactive active surveillance schemes appear to significantly outperform reactive surveillance procedures in all instances. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its severity, that should be applied in the event of a re-emergent outbreak of H5N1 amongst poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh."},
{"title": "Ontology-based similarity calculations with an improved annotation model", "authors": ["Sebastian Koehler"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/199554 ", "abstract": "A typical use case of ontologies is the calculation of similarity scores between items that are annotated with classes of the ontology. For example, in differential diagnostics and disease gene prioritisation, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is often used to compare a query phenotype profile against gold-standard phenotype profiles of diseases or genes. The latter have long been constructed as flat lists of ontology classes, which, as we show in this work, can be improved by exploiting existing structure and information in annotation datasets or full text disease descriptions. We derive a study-wise annotation model of diseases and genes and show that this can improve the performance of semantic similarity measures. Inferred weights of individual annotations are one reason for this improvement, but more importantly using the study-wise structure further boosts the results of the algorithms according to precision-recall analyses. We test the study-wise annotation model for diseases annotated with classes from the HPO and for genes annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) classes. We incorporate this annotation model into similarity algorithms and show how this leads to improved performance. This work adds weight to the need for enhancing simple list-based representations of disease or gene annotations. We show how study-wise annotations can be automatically derived from full text summaries of disease descriptions and from the annotation data provided by the GO Consortium and how semantic similarity measure can utilise this extended annotation model."},

Most dimorphic fungi are found in the family Ajellomycetaceae, including the genera Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Paracoccidioides, and the recently described Emergomyces. To examine the origin of virulence and host adaptation in these fungal pathogens, we compared the gene content of classic systemic, opportunistic, and non-pathogenic species, including new genomes for Emmonsia species and two closely non-pathogenic species, Helicocarpus griseus and Polytolypa hystricis. We examined differences in gene content between pathogens and environmental fungi, and found that gene families related to plant degradation, synthesis of secondary metabolites, and amino acid and lipid metabolism are retained in H. griseus and P. hystricis. Genes of central importance in dimorphic pathogenic fungi such as heat shock response proteins, morphological switch related proteins are conserved in non-pathogenic species. However, we found that changes in the copy number of proteases, phosphotransferases and transcription factors in systemic dimorphic relative to non-dimorphic species may have aided the evolution of specialized gene regulatory programs to rapidly adapt to higher temperatures and new nutritional environments. Notably, we found that both more basal non-pathogenic species appear homothallic, with both mating type locus idiomorphs fused at a single locus, whereas all related pathogenic species are heterothallic. These differences revealed that independent changes in nutrient acquisition capacity but similar host/substrate shift from plants to animals have occurred in the Onygenaceae and Ajellomycetaceae, and highlighted how the dimorphic pathogens from Ajellomycetaceae have adapted to the host immune response and decreased their capacity for life stages in environmental niches."},

Guiley", "Mikhail Dozmorov", "Seth M. Rubin", "Larisa Litovchick"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/199539 ", "abstract": "The oncogene MYBL2 (encoding B-Myb) is a poor prognostic biomarker in many cancers. B-Myb interacts with the MuvB core of five proteins (LIN9, LIN37, LIN52, LIN53/RBBP4, and LIN54) to form the MMB (Myb-MuvB) complex and promotes expression of late cell cycle genes necessary for progression through mitosis. Both MYBL2 amplification and over-expression are associated with deregulation of the cell cycle and increased cell proliferation. Alternatively, by interacting with E2F4-DP1 and p130 or p107, the MuvB core becomes part of the DREAM complex (DP, RB-like, E2F, and MuvB). The DREAM complex opposes MMB by globally repressing cell cycle genes in G0/G1, maintaining the cell in a quiescent state. However, the specific mechanism by which B-Myb alters the cell cycle is not well understood. Our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed significant upregulation of DREAM and MMB target genes in breast and ovarian cancer with MYBL2 gain. Given that most of the DREAM target genes are not directly regulated by B-Myb, we investigated the effects of B-Myb on DREAM formation. We found that depletion of B-Myb results in increased DREAM formation in human cancer cells, while its overexpression inhibits DREAM formation in the non-transformed cells. Since the MuvB core subunit LIN52 is essential for assembly of both the DREAM and MMB complexes, we tested whether B-Myb disrupts DREAM by sequestering LIN52. Overexpression of LIN52 did not increase either DREAM or MMB formation, but instead increased the turnover rate of the endogenous LIN52 protein. Interestingly, co-expression of B-Myb increased the expression of both endogenous and overexpressed LIN52 while knockdown of B-Myb had an opposite effect. We found that regulation of LIN52 occurs at the protein level, and that activity of DYRK1A kinase, the enzyme that triggers DREAM complex formation by phosphorylating LIN52, is required for this regulation. These findings are the first to implicate B-Myb in the disassembly of the DREAM complex and offer insight into the underlying mechanisms of poor prognostic value of MYBL2 amplification in cancer. We conclude that B-Myb mediates its oncogenic effects not only by increasing mitotic gene expression by the MMB complex, but also by broad disruption of cell cycle gene regulatory programs through compromised DREAM formation."},

Despite the biological importance of these polysaccharides, their biosynthetic pathways have received limited attention. The important human pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes, synthesizes a key antigenic surface polymer-the Lancefield group A carbohydrate (GAC). GAC is covalently attached to peptidoglycan and consists of a polyrhamnose polymer, with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chains, which is an essential virulence determinant. The molecular details of the mechanism of polyrhamnose modification with GlcNAc are currently unknown. In this report, using molecular genetics, analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrated that GAC biosynthesis requires two distinct undecaprenol-linked GlcNAc-lipid intermediates: GlcNAc-pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol (GlcNAc-P-P-Und) produced by the GlcNAc-phosphate transferase GacO and GlcNAc-phosphate-undecaprenol (GlcNAc-P-Und) produced by the glycosyltransferase GacI. Further investigations revealed that the GAC polyrhamnose backbone is assembled on GlcNAc-P-P-Und. Our results also suggested that a GT-C glycosyltranferase, GacL, transfers GlcNAc from GlcNAc-P-Und to polyrhamnose. Moreover, GacJ, a small membrane-associated protein, formed a complex with GacI and significantly stimulated its catalytic activity. Of note, we observed that GacI homologs perform a similar function in Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. In conclusion, the elucidation of GAC biosynthesis in S. pyogenes reported here enhances our understanding of how other Gram-positive bacteria produce essential components of their cell wall."},

Participants of all ages from Lower River Region (LRR) (N = 1028) and Upper River Region (URR) (N = 840) underwent examination for trachoma and had blood collected for detection of antibodies against the Ct antigen Pgp3, by ELISA. Overall, 30 (1.6%) individuals had active trachoma; the prevalence in children aged 1-9 years was 3.4% (25/742) with no statistically significant difference in prevalence between the regions. There was a significant difference in overall seroprevalence by region: 26.2% in LRR and 17.1% in URR (p<0.0001). In children 1-9 years old, seroprevalence was 4.4% in LRR and 3.9% in URR. Reversible catalytic models using information on age-specific seroprevalence demonstrated a decrease in the transmission of Ct infection in both regions, possibly reflecting the impact of improved access to water, health and sanitation as well as mass drug administration campaigns. Serological testing for antibodies to Ct antigens is potentially useful for trachoma programmes, but consideration should be given to the co-endemicity of sexually transmitted Ct infections."},

Here we present loss- and gain-of-function studies of Spindly in Drosophila. We investigated the requirements of distinct protein domains for the localisation and function of Spindly. We find that knock-down of Spindly results in a range of mitotic defects in the female germ line and during cleavage divisions in embryogenesis. Overexpression of Spindly in the female germ line is embryonic lethal and results in altered egg morphology. To determine whether Spindly plays a role in post-mitotic cells we altered Spindly protein levels in migrating cells and found that ovarian border cell migration is sensitive to the levels of Spindly protein.

Segments of actin bound to cofilin adapt an alternative twist. This configuration is stable, but boundaries between cofilin occupied and unoccupied polymer are weak and fragment. Coronin and Aip1 are two factors that promote cofilin mediated actin filament disassembly, but whether they simply accelerate the basic cofilin severing mechanism or alter the mode of filament disassembly is still being investigated. Using electron microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that coronin accelerates phosphate release from F-actin to stimulate highly cooperative cofilin binding on to the polymer creating long stretches with a hypertwisted morphology. We find that Aip1 attacks these hypertwisted regions along their length, not just the boundaries, causing sections to disintegrate into monomers. Therefore, coronin promotes cofilin binding to F-actin to generate longer segments of polymer that are themselves the substrates for Aip1 mediated disintegration, as opposed to simply creating more heterotypic junctions that would sever. The morphological characteristics of the disassembling filaments along with spectroscopic data showing the rapid liberation of actin monomers suggest that the combination of cofilin, coronin, and Aip1 might be triggering a more catastrophic mode of filament disassembly than severing."},

The data recapitulate major regulatory classes of TSSs, based on peak width, promoter-proximal polymerase pausing, and cis-regulatory element density. We confirm the paucity of divergent transcription units in D. melanogaster, but also identify notable exceptions. Furthermore, we identify thousands of novel initiation events occurring at unannotated TSSs that can be classified into functional categories by their local density of histone modifications. Interestingly, a sub-class of these unannotated TSSs overlaps with functionally validated enhancer elements, consistent with a regulatory role for \u201cenhancer RNAs\u201d in defining transcriptional programs important for animal development.

Microtubules are decorated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that organize the cytoskeleton, regulate microtubule dynamics and modulate the interaction between motor proteins and microtubules to direct intracellular transport. Tau is a neuronal MAP that stabilizes axonal microtubules and crosslinks them into bundles. Dysregulation of tau leads to a range of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau reduces the processivity of kinesin and dynein by acting as an obstacle on the microtubule. Single-molecule assays indicate that kinesin-1 is more strongly inhibited than kinesin-2 or dynein, suggesting tau might act to spatially modulate the activity of specific motors. To investigate the role of tau in regulating bidirectional transport, we isolated phagosomes driven by kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein and reconstituted their motility along microtubules. We find that tau biases bidirectional motility towards the microtubule minus-end in a dose-dependent manner. Optical trapping measurements show that tau increases the magnitude and frequency of forces exerted by dynein through inhibiting opposing kinesin motors. Mathematical modeling indicates that tau controls the directional bias of intracellular cargoes through differentially tuning the processivity of kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tau modulates motility in a motor-specific manner to direct intracellular transport, and suggests that dysregulation of tau might contribute to neurodegeneration by disrupting the balance of plus- and minus-end directed transport."},

The visual cortex of the blind has been observed to support higher cognitive functions including language and numerical processing. This functional shift is hypothesized to reflect a metamodal cortical function, where computations are defined by the local network. In the case of developmental deafferentation, local circuits are considered to implement higher cognitive functions by accommodating diverse long-distance inputs. However, the extent to which visual deprivation triggers a reorganization of the large-scale network in the cortex is still controversial. Here we show that early prenatal ablation of the retina, an experimental model of anophthalmia in macaque, leads to a major reduction of area V1 and the creation of a default extrastriate cortex (DEC). Anophthalmic and normal macaques received retrograde tracer injections in DEC, as well as areas V2 and V4 post-natally. This revealed a six-fold expansion of the spatial extent of local connectivity in the DEC and a surprisingly high location of the DEC derived from a computational model of the cortical hierarchy. In the anophthalmic the set of areas projecting to the DEC, area V2 and V4 does not differ from that of normal adult controls, but there is a highly significant increase in the relative cumulative weight of the ventral stream areas input to the early visual areas. These findings show that although occupying the territory that would have become primary visual cortex the DEC exhibits features of a higher order area, thus reflecting a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on cortical specification. Understanding the interaction of these contributing factors will shed light on cortical plasticity during primate development and the neurobiology of blindness."},

The cellular activity patterns underlying these cross-modal influences, however, are not known and measurements in intact animals during ethologically relevant behaviours are lacking. We examined the hypothesis that, during real-world behaviour, tactile inputs are encoded in the rodent primary visual cortex (V1) enabling the contextualisation of visual signals. We studied cellular activity in mouse V1 during active exploration of a controlled tactile environment. We identified a population of V1 neurons that specifically encodes tactile stimuli sensed by the whiskers. The neurons show activation in response to tactile stimuli independent of visual inputs. The responses are diverse and selective providing diverse contextual and locational information. In addition, V1 visually responsive cells show response modulations linked to tactile stimuli suggesting they receive subthreshold inputs from tactile neurons. These results indicate that mouse V1 encodes functionally diverse cross-modal signals during real-world behaviour. They suggest a coding strategy whereby signals from distant brain regions converge onto functionally distinct cell groups in primary sensory areas to mediate contextual modulations of primary sensory activity. This convergence may enable early multisensory associations in aid of navigation or exploration behaviours."},

Specifically, the ancestors of a donor species must have existed before the descendants of the recipient species. Hence, the detection of a transfer event can be translated into a time constraint between nodes of a phylogeny if the donor and recipient can be identified. When a set of transfers are detected by interpreting the phylogenetic discordance between gene trees and a species tree, the set of all deduced time constraints can be used to rank the species tree, i.e. order totally its internal nodes. Unfortunately lateral gene transfer detection is challenging and current methods produce a significant proportion of false positives. As a result a set of time constraints deduced from predicted transfers is not always compatible with any ranking of the species tree. We propose a method, implemented in a software called MaxTiC (Maximum Time Consistency), which takes as input a species tree and a series of possibly inconsistent time constraints between its internal nodes, weighted by confidence scores. MaxTiC outputs a ranked species tree compatible with a subset of constraints with maximum confidence score sum. We extensively test the method on simulated datasets, under a wide range of conditions that we compare to measures on biological datasets. In most conditions the obtained ranked tree is very close to the real one, confirming the theoretical possibility of dating the history of life with transfers by maximizing time consistency.

In this study, we proposed VASC (deep Variational Autoencoder for scRNA-seq data), a deep multi-layer generative model, for the unsupervised dimension reduction and visualization of scRNA-seq data. It can explicitly model the dropout events and find the nonlinear hierarchical feature representations of the original data. Tested on twenty datasets, VASC shows superior performances in most cases and broader dataset compatibility compared with four state-of-the-art dimension reduction methods. Then, for a case study of pre-implantation embryos, VASC successfully re-establishes the cell dynamics and identifies several candidate marker genes associated with the early embryo development."},

For example, several different fast programs have been developed in the very popular maximum likelihood framework, including RAxML/ExaML, PhyML, IQ-TREE, and FastTree. Although these four programs are widely used, a systematic evaluation and comparison of their performance using empirical genome-scale data matrices has so far been lacking. To address this question, we evaluated these four programs on 19 empirical phylogenomic data sets from diverse animal, plant, and fungal lineages with respect to likelihood maximization, tree topology, and computational speed. For single-gene tree inference, we found that the more exhaustive and slower strategies (ten searches per alignment) outperformed faster strategies (one tree search per alignment) using RAxML, PhyML, or IQ-TREE. Interestingly, single-gene trees inferred by the three programs yielded comparable coalescent-based species tree estimations. For concatenation-based species tree inference, IQ-TREE consistently achieved the best-observed likelihoods for all data sets, and RAxML/ExaML was a close second. In contrast, PhyML often failed to complete concatenation-based analyses, whereas FastTree was the fastest but generated lower likelihood values and more dissimilar tree topologies in both types of analyses. Finally, data matrix properties, such as the number of taxa and the strength of phylogenetic signal, sometimes substantially influenced the relative performance of the programs. Our results provide real-world gene and species tree phylogenetic inference benchmarks to inform the design and execution of large-scale phylogenomic data analyses."},

This phenomenon depends on expectation affecting the cortical processing of sensory information. However, virtually nothing is known on the mechanisms responsible for the effects of expectation on sensory networks. Here, we report a novel computational mechanism underlying the expectation-dependent acceleration of coding observed in the gustatory cortex (GC) of alert rats. We use a recurrent spiking network model with a clustered architecture capturing essential features of cortical activity, including the metastable activity observed in GC before and after gustatory stimulation. Relying both on network theory and computer simulations, we propose that expectation exerts its function by modulating the intrinsically generated dynamics preceding taste delivery. Our model, whose predictions are confirmed in the experimental data, demonstrates how the modulation of intrinsic metastable activity can shape sensory coding and mediate cognitive processes such as the expectation of relevant events. Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of expectation and ascribe a new functional role to intrinsically generated, metastable activity."},

With more than 2000 drugs approved worldwide and 6 relevant targets per drug on average, the potential is quantitatively important. In this paper, we have attempted to quantify the number of non-cancer drugs supported by either preclinical or clinical cancer data.  Methods: A PubMed search was performed to identify non-cancer drugs which could be repurposed in one or more cancer types. Drugs needed at least one peer-reviewed article showing an anticancer effect in vitro, in vivo or in humans.  Results: A total of 235 eligible non-cancer drugs were identified (Table 1). Main characteristics of the drugs are summarized in Table 2. 67 (29%) are on the WHO list of essential medicines and 176 (75%) are off-patent. 133 (57%) had human data in cancer patient(s). Four were listed in clinical guidelines, namely thalidomide, all-trans retinoic acid, zoledronic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Several drugs have shown a survival benefit in randomized trials such as cimetidine (colorectal cancer), progesterone (breast cancer) or itraconazole (lung cancer). Several other drugs induced responses in rare tumours, like clarithromycin, timolol or propranolol.  Conclusion: We have found that the number of off-patent repurposing opportunities is large and increasing. Joint non-commercial clinical development (academics, governments, charities) may bring new therapeutic options to patients at low cost, especially in indications for which the industry has no incentive to invest in."},

Previous copy number variants (CNVs) studies of epilepsy have used array-based technology and were restricted to the detection of large or exonic events. In contrast, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to more comprehensively profile CNVs but existing analytic methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity. We show that this is in part due to the non-uniformity of read coverage, even after intra-sample normalization. To improve on this, we developed PopSV, an algorithm that uses multiple samples to control for technical variation and enables the robust detection of CNVs. Using WGS and PopSV, we performed a comprehensive characterization of CNVs in 198 individuals affected with epilepsy and 301 controls. We found an enrichment of rare exonic events in epilepsy patients, especially in genes with predicted loss-of-function intolerance. Notably, this genome-wide survey also revealed an enrichment of rare non-coding CNVs near previously known epilepsy genes. This enrichment was strongest for non-coding CNVs located within 100 Kbp of an epilepsy gene and in regions associated with changes in the gene expression, such as expression QTLs or DNase I hypersensitive sites. Finally, we report on 21 potentially damaging events that could be associated with known or new candidate epilepsy genes. Our results suggest that comprehensive profiling of CNVs could help explain a larger fraction of epilepsy cases."},

To this end, Tapered Optical Fibers (TFs) represent a minimally-invasive tool that can deliver light over either large brain volumes or spatially confined subregions. This work links the emission properties of TFs with the modal content injected into the fiber, finding that the maximum transversal propagation constant (kt) and the total number of guided modes sustained by the waveguide are key parameters for engineering the mode demultiplexing properties of TFs. Intrinsic features of the optical fiber (numerical aperture and core/cladding diameter) define the optically active segment of the taper (up to ~3mm), along which a linear relation between the propagating set of kt values and the emission position exists. These site-selective light delivery properties are preserved at multiple wavelengths, further extending the range of applications expected for tapered fibers for optical control of neural activity."},

To dissociate these functions, we introduced a task that parametrically varied low-level stimulus features (orientation and color) for fine-grained analysis of perceptual function, and that also required participants to switch their attention between feature dimensions on a trial-by-trial basis, thus taxing executive processes. Our response paradigm captured task-irrelevant motor output (TIMO), reflecting failures to use the correct stimulus-response rule. ADHD patients had substantially worse perceptual function than Controls, especially for orientation. ADHD participants had also higher TIMO; this measure was strongly affected by the switch manipulation. Across participants, the perceptual variability parameter was correlated with TIMO, suggesting that perceptual deficits could underlie executive function deficits. Based on perceptual variability alone, we were able to classify participants into ADHD and Controls with a mean accuracy of about 77%. Participants' self-reported General Executive Composite score correlated not only with TIMO but also with the perceptual variability parameter. Our results highlight the role of perceptual deficits in ADHD and the usefulness of computational modeling of behavior in dissociating perceptual from executive processes."},

These beliefs can influence the processing of food rewards and impact decision making beyond objective sensory properties. However, no studies, within or beyond the food domain, have assessed how written information, such as food labels, affect implicit motivation to obtain rewards, even though choices in daily life might be strongly driven by implicit motivational biases. We investigated how written information affects implicit motivation to obtain food rewards. We used food labels (high- and low-calorie), associated with an identical lemonade, to study motivation for food rewards during fMRI. In a joystick task, hungry participants (N=31) were instructed to make fast approach or avoid movements to earn the cued drinks. Behaviorally, we found a general approach bias, which was stronger for the drink that was most preferred during a subsequent choice test, i.e. the one labeled as low-calorie. This behavioral effect was accompanied by increased BOLD signal in the sensorimotor cortex during the response phase of the task for the preferred, low-calorie drink compared with the non-preferred, high-calorie drink. During the anticipation phase, the non-preferred, high-calorie drink label elicited stronger fMRI signal in the right ventral anterior insula, a region associated with aversion and taste intensity, than the preferred, low-calorie label. Together, these data suggest that high-calorie labeling can increase avoidance of drinks and reduce neural activity in brain regions associated with motor control. In conclusion, we show effects of food labeling on fMRI responses during anticipation and subsequent motivated action and on behavior, in the absence of objective taste differences, demonstrating the influence of written information on implicit biases. These findings contribute to our understanding of implicit biases in real-life eating behavior."},

Whereas attentional goals often have both spatial and featural components, most research on the neural basis of attention has examined these components separately. This may reflect the fact that attention is typically studied in individual visual areas that preferentially code for either spatial locations or particular features. Here we investigated how these attentional components are integrated by examining the attentional modulation of functional connectivity between visual areas with different selectivity. Specifically, we used fMRI to measure temporal correlations between spatially-selective regions of early visual cortex and category-selective regions in ventral temporal cortex while participants performed a task that benefitted from both spatial and categorical attention. We found that categorical attention modulated the connectivity of category-selective areas, but only with retinotopic areas that coded for the spatially attended location. The reverse was not true, however, with spatial attention modulating the connectivity of retinotopic areas with category-selective areas coding for both attended and unattended features. This pattern of results suggests that attentional modulation of connectivity is dominated by spatial selection, which in turn gates featural biases. Combined with exploratory analyses of frontoparietal areas that track these changes in connectivity among visual areas, this study begins to shed light on how different components of attention are integrated in support of more complex behavioral goals."},

More transcripts (1600) were oscillating in experimental epilepsy, with only one fourth oscillating in both conditions. Proteomics confirmed these results. Metabolic activity and targets of antiepileptic drugs displayed different circadian regulation in control and epilepsy. Hence, the hippocampus, and perhaps other cortical regions, shows a daily remapping of its molecular landscape, which would enable different functioning modes during the night/day cycle. The impact of this remapping in brain pathologies needs to be taken into account not only to study their mechanisms, but also to design drug treatments and time their delivery."},

However, it is unknown whether a single underlying mechanism explains these changes. Age-related changes in economic risk taking are explained by reduced Pavlovian biases that promote action toward reward. Although Pavlovian biases also promote inaction in the face of punishment, the role such Pavlovian biases play in motor decision-making, which additionally depends on estimating the probability of successfully executing an action, is unknown. To address this, we developed a novel app-based motor decision-making task to measure sensitivity to reward and punishment when subjects (n=26,532) made a go/no-go motor gamble based on the perceived ability to execute a complex action. Using a newly established approach-avoidance computational model, we show motor decision-making is also subject to Pavlovian influences, and that healthy ageing is mainly associated with a reduction in Pavlovian bias toward reward. In a subset of participants playing an independent economic decision-making task (n=17,220), we demonstrate similar decision-making tendencies across motor and economic domains. Computational models that incorporate Pavlovian biases thus provide unifying accounts for motor and economic decision-making."},

We considered whether such slowing relates to uncertainty about the value of these options, which arises from the tendency to avoid them during learning, and whether such slowing relates to fronto-subthalamic inhibitory control mechanisms. 49 participants performed a reinforcement-learning task and a stop-signal task while fMRI was recorded. A reinforcement-learning model was used to quantify learning strategies. Individual differences in lose-lose slowing related to information uncertainty due to sampling, and independently, to less efficient response inhibition in the stop-signal task. Neuroimaging analysis revealed an analogous dissociation: subthalamic nucleus (STN) BOLD activity related to variability in stopping latencies, whereas weaker fronto-subthalamic connectivity related to slowing and information sampling. Across tasks, fast inhibitors increased STN activity for successfully cancelled responses in the stop task, but decreased activity for lose-lose choices. These data support the notion that fronto-STN communication implements a rapid but transient brake on response execution, and that slowing due to decision uncertainty could result from an inefficient release of this 'hold your horses' mechanism."},

As this outcome may represent a critical effect of these substances, calculation of benchmark dose (BMD) results would be useful for standards setting to protect exposed populations against adverse effects. However, in the mixed exposure setting of most epidemiological evidence, the two major and inter-related substances associated with this adverse effect have shown similar benchmark results that raise concerns about possible confounding. \nMethods:  With the aim of better characterizing the immunotoxicity impact of the two major perfluorinated substances in the mixed exposures, we carried out BMD calculations on prospective data from two prospective birth cohort studies from the Faroe Islands with a total of 1,146 children. Exposure data included serum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate at birth and at age 5 years and, as outcome parameters, the serum concentrations of specific IgG antibodies against tetanus and diphtheria at ages 5 and 7. We calculated the BMDs and their lower confidence bounds (BMDLs) and included mutual adjustment for the two compounds. \nResults:  The BMDLs for the two immunotoxicants were of similar magnitude before and after adjustment. Both substances showed lower results for a logarithmic dose-response model, which also provided a slightly better fit than a linear dose model for both antibodies. We also used a broken curve shape that allowed a different slope below the median exposure. Postnatal exposure as represented by the age 5 serum concentration, showed a stronger association with the antibody outcomes than the prenatal exposure. Due to the correlation between the two immunotoxicants, the mutual adjustment resulted in elevated BMD results and p values. However, the BMDL values were virtually unchanged. \nConclusions:  Adjustment for co-exposure to another immunotoxicant increased the variance and the BMD values, but affected the BMDL values only to a negligible extent. These calculations are in accordance with an interpretation that, when two toxicants appear to affect an outcome to an almost equal degree and none of them is known to be solely responsible, the exposures should both be considered responsible and attract equal regulatory attention until further evidence shows otherwise."},

More than 30 million people have already died and HIV/AIDS is ranked the third largest pandemic after the 14th century Black Death and the 1918 influenza pandemic.  HIV continues to spread and 37 million people are living with HIV (PLHIV) globally. Ending the HIV pandemic is necessary and feasible but poses a number of important challenges. \nFindings\nThe HIV response can be characterized by three overlapping phases: 1) Devastation 2) Discovery and 3) Ending AIDS.  After coming to our attention in 1981, the HIV pandemic has infected over 70 million people, caused over 39 million deaths, and has had a devastating impact.  The Discovery Phase resulted from community, scientific, and political response that unraveled the secrets of HIV more rapidly than any other pathogen in history.  The End of AIDS phase represents the shift from a chronic struggle with hopes pinned on a future vaccine or cure to a winnable public health battle.  Scientific evidence demonstrates that increasing HIV testing and treatment prevents illness including AIDS, deaths and HIV transmission.  To End AIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), national governments and cities adopted the 90-90-90 targets: by 2020, 90% of people living with HIV diagnosed, 90% of people diagnosed on sustained ART, and of those, 90% virally suppressed. Ending AIDS includes the epidemiological target of reducing AIDS cases and HIV incidence to less than 1 per 1000 population per annum. As part of Ending AIDS, 35 million people living with HIV will require treatment until a cure or vaccine can be developed and made widely available. Five major innovations will accelerate progress of 90-90-90 and the end of AIDS: 1) reliable, easy-to-use, HIV self-tests 2) same-day integrase inhibitor based treatment regimens 3) expanded access to integrated multi-disease community-based HIV services 4) improved monitoring and evaluation using national cohorts and unique identifiers and 5) global leadership around HIV epidemic control objectives and priority interventions\nInterpretation\nGlobal public health security and human rights demand that we focus on ending AIDS for the millions of people living with HIV and impacted by the pandemic.

The io single module system (Atlas Genetics Ltd) runs clinical samples through a microfluidic CT cartridge, delivering results in 30 minutes. We evaluated its performance on female genital samples in four UK Genito-Urinary Medicine (GUM)/RSH clinics.  Methods: Prospective diagnostic accuracy study, using BD ProbeTec CT/GC assay as the routine clinic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) as the initial comparator test, and the QIAgen Artus CT assay to resolve discrepancies. In these instances, the reference standard was defined as the resolved result when two out of three assay results concurred. Female participants aged \u226516 provided additional-to-routine self-collected vulvovaginal swabs. Samples were tested fresh with the io CT assay within 7 days of collection, or were frozen at -80C for later testing. Participant clinical, demographic and behavioural characteristics were collected to assess risk factors associated with CT infection.  Results: Of 785 participants recruited, final analyses were conducted on 709 (90.3%). CT prevalence was 7.2% (51/709) overall. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the io CT assay were, respectively, 96.1% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 86.5-99.5), 97.7% (95%CI: 96.3-98.7), 76.6% (95%CI: 64.3-86.2) and 99.7% (95%CI: 98.9-100).

{"title": "Maximum Entropy Methods for Extracting the Learned Features of Deep Neural Networks", "authors": ["Alex I Finnegan", "Jun S Song"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/105957 ", "abstract": "New architectures of multilayer artificial neural networks and new methods for training them are rapidly revolutionizing the application of machine learning in diverse fields, including business, social science, physical sciences, and biology. Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed- forward neural networks."},

Here we present its first epidemiological assessment by investigating attack and observation rates from 7,580 ZIKV notified cases and 18 microcephaly reports between July 2015 to May 2016. The basic reproductive number of the outbreak in Cabo Verde was estimated around 1.66 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.39-1.98), similar to that reported in the Americas. Assuming that the microcephaly risk per pregnancy is identical between Cabo Verde and the Americas we extrapolate that ~56% (CI: 47 to 65)% of the population may have been infected with ZIKV. Our results highlight the need for rapid and integrated epidemiological, molecular and genomic arbovirus surveillance to tackle forthcoming outbreaks in Cabo Verde and other African nations."},

Combinations of interventions can have complex interactions at the population level. These often cannot be adequately addressed with standard study designs and analytic methods. Simulations can help to accurately represent transmission dynamics in an increasingly complex world which is critical for proper trial design and interpretation. Some ethical aspects of a trial can also be quantified using simulations. After a trial has been conducted, simulations can be used to explore possible explanations for the observed effects.

The limiting determinant of telomerase activity is the catalytic component TERT, and TERT expression is closely correlated with telomerase activity and cancer initiation and disease progression. For this reason the regulation of TERT levels in the cell is of great importance. microRNAs (miRs) function as an additional regulatory level in cells, crucial for defining expression boundaries, proper cell fate decisions, cell cycle control, genome integrity, cell death and metastasis. We performed an anti-miR library screen to identity novel miRs, which participate in the control of telomerase. We identified the tumor suppressor miR (miR-128) as a novel endogenous telomerase inhibitor and determined that miR-128 significantly reduces the mRNA and protein levels of Tert in a panel of cancer cell lines. We further evaluated the mechanism by which miR-128 regulates TERT and demonstrated that miR-128 interacts directly with the coding sequence of TERT mRNA in both HeLa cells and teratoma cells. Interestingly, the functional miR-128 binding site in TERT mRNA, is conserved between TERT and the other cellular reverse transcriptase encoded by Long Interspaced Elements-1 (LINE-1 or L1), which can also contribute to the oncogenic phenotype of cancer. This finding supports the novel idea that miRs may function in parallel pathways to inhibit tumorigenesis, by regulating a group of enzymes (RT) by targeting conserved binding sites in the coding region of both enzymes."},

We have previously brought together some of the considerable evidence that a (dormant) microbial component is commonly a significant part of its aetiology. However, apart from recognising, consistent with this view, that the many inflammatory markers of PE are also increased in infection, we had little to say about immunity, whether innate or adaptive. In addition, we focussed on the gut, oral and female urinary tract microbiomes as the main sources of the infection. We here marshall further evidence for an infectious component in PE, focussing on the immunological tolerance characteristic of pregnancy, and the well-established fact that increased exposure to the father's semen assists this immunological tolerance. As well as these benefits, however, semen is not sterile, microbial tolerance mechanisms may exist, and we also review the evidence that semen may be responsible for inoculating the developing conceptus with microbes, not all of which are benign. It is suggested that when they are not, this may be a significant cause of pre-eclampsia. A variety of epidemiological and other evidence is entirely consistent with this, not least correlations between semen infection, infertility and PE. Our view also leads to a series of other, testable predictions. Overall, we argue for a significant paternal role in the development of PE through microbial infection of the mother via insemination."},

Studies have been showed that maternal protein-restricted adult offspring, present pronounced reduction of nephron number associated with decreased fractional urinary sodium excretion and arterial hypertension. Also, recent advances in our understanding of the molecular pathways that govern the association of gestational nutritional restriction, intrauterine growth retardation inflammation with impaired nephrogenesis, nephron underdosing and kidney fibrosis point to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as the common.  Method. In the current study, the protein and sodium urinary excretion rates were evaluated and immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques were used to characterize the whole kidney structure changes in 16-wk old male LP offspring compared with age-matched controls. We also verify the expression of miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins markers of fibrosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in entire kidney prepared from LP offspring.  Results. In the current study, we may assume that arterial hypertension and long-term hyperfiltration process manifests, itself by proteinuria was accompanied by increased whole kidney mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b21, ZEB1, type I collagen and, fibronectin in parallel to decreased expression of E-cadherin in 16-wk old LP offspring. Surprisingly, the renal tissue miR-129, miR-141, miR-200c and miR-429 were significantly upregulated in LP offspring compared to age-matched NP rats.  Conclusion. Considering that the overload in remaining nephrons, we may state that hypertension and proteinuria development following maternal protein restriction, may be a preponderant factor for the development of EMT and fibrous process and altered kidney ultrastructure in rat offspring. However, further studies are required to assess the contribution of miRNAs on renal injury progression in gestational protein-restricted model of fetal programming."},
{"title": "Sleep and the gut microbiome: antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiota reduces nocturnal sleep in mice", "authors": ["Jonathan Elliott Lendrum", "Bradley Seebach", "Barrett Klein", "Sumei Liu"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/199075 ", "abstract": "Several bacterial cell wall components such as peptidoglycan and muramyl peptide are potent inducers of mammalian slow-wave sleep when exogenously administered to freely behaving animals. It has been proposed that the native gut microflora may serve as a quasi-endogenous pool of somnogenic bacterial cell wall products given their quantity and close proximity to the intestinal portal. This proposal suggests that deliberate manipulation of the host's intestinal flora may elicit changes in host sleep behavior. To test this possibility, we evaluated 24 h of sleep-wake behavior after depleting the gut microbiota with a 14 d broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen containing high doses of ampicillin, metronidazole, neomycin, and vancomycin. High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene was used to confirm depletion of fecal bacteria and sleep-wake vigilance states were determined using videosomnography techniques based on previously established behavioral criteria shown to highly correlate with standard polysomnography-based methods. Additionally, considering that germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice have been earlier shown to display increased locomotor activity, and since locomotor activity has been used as a reliable proxy of sleep, we suspected that the elevated locomotor activity previously reported in these animals may reflect an unreported reduction in sleep behavior. To examine this potential relationship, we also quantified locomotor activity on a representative subsample of the same 24 h of video recordings using the automated video-tracking software ANY-maze. We found that antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiota reduced nocturnal sleep, but not diurnal sleep. Likewise, antibiotic-treated mice showed increased nocturnal locomotor activity, but not diurnal locomotor activity. Taken together, these results support a link between the gut microbiome and nocturnal sleep and locomotor physiology in adult mice. Additionally, our findings indicate that antibiotics may be insomnogenic via their ability to diminish gut-derived bacterial somnogens. Given that antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in human medicine, these findings have important implications for clinical practice with respect to prolonged antibiotic therapy, insomnia, and other idiopathic sleep-wake and circadian-rhythm disorders affecting an estimated 50-70 million people in the United States alone."},

Empirical studies suggest that withdrawal of noradrenergic and serotonergic drives importantly contribute to depression of hypoglossal motoneurons during rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep and, therefore, may contribute to OSA pathophysiology; however, specific cellular and synaptic mechanisms remain unknown. It was recently suggested that, in order to explain experimental observations, the neuronal network for monoaminergic control of excitability of hypoglossal motoneurons has to include excitatory and inhibitory perihypoglossal interneurons that would mediate noradrenergic and serotonergic drives to the motoneurons. In this study, we applied a biophysical network model to validate the rationality of the proposed circuit and to investigate the dynamics of its neuronal populations during REM sleep-induced withdrawal of noradrenergic and serotonergic drives. The model mimicked state-dependent activity of the model hypoglossal motoneurons during simulated REM sleep with or without a virtual application of noradrenergic and serotonergic drugs was in qualitative agreement with in vivo data. The study predicts the dynamics of the perihypoglossal interneurons during these conditions and corroborates the hypothesis that the excitatory interneurons may integrate both noradrenergic and serotonergic drives. The latter drive has to be mediated by the inhibitory interneurons. The study suggests that perihypoglossal interneurons may serve as novel potential targets for pharmacological treatment of OSA."},

Sperling", "Isabel Sanmartin"], "doi": " https://doi.org/10.1101/198960 ", "abstract": "In macroevolution, the Red Queen (RQ) model posits that biodiversity dynamics depend mainly on species-intrinsic biotic factors such as interactions among species or life-history traits, while the Court Jester (CJ) model states that extrinsic environmental abiotic factors have a stronger role. Until recently, a lack of relevant methodological approaches has prevented the unraveling of contributions from these two types of factors to the evolutionary history of a lineage. Here we take advantage of the rapid development of new macroevolution models that tie diversification rates to changes in paleoenvironmental (extrinsic) and/or biotic (intrinsic) factors. We inferred a robust and fully-sampled species-level phylogeny, as well as divergence times and ancestral geographic ranges, and related these to the radiation of Apollo butterflies (Parnassiinae) using both extant (molecular) and extinct (fossil/morphological) evidence. We tested whether their diversification dynamics are better explained by a RQ or CJ hypothesis, by assessing whether speciation and extinction were mediated by diversity-dependence (niche filling) and clade-dependent host-plant association (RQ) or by large-scale continuous changes in extrinsic factors such as climate or geology (CJ). For the RQ hypothesis, we found significant differences in speciation rates associated with different host-plants but detected no sign of diversity-dependence. For CJ, the role of Himalayan-Tibetan building was substantial for biogeography but not a driver of high speciation, while positive dependence between warm climate and speciation/extinction was supported by continuously varying maximum-likelihood models. We find that rather than a single factor, the joint effect of multiple factors (biogeography, species traits, environmental drivers, and mass extinction) is responsible for current diversity patterns, and that the same factor might act differently across clades, emphasizing the notion of opportunity. This study confirms the importance of the confluence of several factors rather than single explanations in modeling diversification within lineages."},

It was previously reported that withdrawal of IL3 from Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells caused decreased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1, leading to reduced glucose uptake, so that arrested cells required Atg5-dependent autophagy for long-term survival. In other cell types, a decrease in Glut1 is mediated by thioredoxin-interacting protein Txnip, which is induced in IL3-dependent myeloid cells when growth factor is removed. To confirm whether the sustained viability of IL3-deprived Bax-/-Bak1-/- myeloid cells required Atg5-dependent autophagy, and to determine whether Txnip was necessary for the reduction in Glut1, we mutated Atg5 and Txnip by CRISPR/Cas9. We found that Atg5-dependent autophagy was not necessary the long-term viability of cycling or arrested Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells, and that Txnip was not required for the decrease in Glut1 expression in response to withdrawal of growth factor. Surprisingly, in glucose-free medium, both wild-type and Bax/Bak1 double mutant cells not only survived, but continued to cycle when IL3 was present. In contrast, Bax+/+Bak1+/+ cells died by apoptosis when deprived of glutamine, and while Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells deprived of glutamine survived, they arrested even when IL3 was present. Thus, glutamine, but neither Atg5-dependent autophagy nor glucose uptake, is necessary for cell division, and none are needed for arrested Bax-/-Bak1-/- myeloid cells to survive for several weeks."},

In this report, we unveil the detailed mechanism of how the dynamic interaction of thermodynamic states (critical states) enables the genome system to pass through the critical transition state to achieve genome reprogramming. Self-organized criticality (SOC) control of overall expression provides a snapshot of self-organization and explains the coexistence of critical states at a certain experimental time point. The time-development of self-organization is dynamically modulated by exchanges in expression flux between critical states through the cell nucleus milieu, where sequential global perturbations involving activation-inhibition of multiple critical states occur from the early state to the late 2-cell state. Two cyclic fluxes act as feedback flow and generate critical-state coherent oscillatory dynamics. Dynamic perturbation of these cyclic flows due to vivid activation of the ensemble of low-variance expression (sub-critical state) genes allows the genome system to overcome a transition state during reprogramming. Our findings imply that a universal mechanism of long-term global RNA oscillation underlies autonomous SOC control, and the critical gene ensemble at a critical point (CP) drives genome reprogramming. Unveiling the corresponding molecular players will be essential to understand single-cell reprogramming."},

Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of Brd4 reproducibly abrogated the sex differences in the GBM phenotype; male cells became less clonogenic, proliferative, and tumorigenic, while female cells became more clonogenic. Finally, sexual dimorphism in Brd4 function was consistent with sex differences in the effect of low Brd4 expression on survival in GBM patients. These data establish for the first time that sex is an intrinsic element of cellular identity, and that it is driven by differential Brd4 activity, which renders male and female cells differentially sensitive to JQ1 treatment."},

Plant-associated oomycetes were frequent in all three early successional sites, occurring in 38-65% of plant roots, but rare (average 3%) in all older ecosystems. Oomycetes were highly host specific, and more frequent on those plant species that declined most strongly in abundance between ecosystem ages. The results support the particular importance of plant-associated oomycetes in early succession (up to 70 years). High host specificity and correlations of abundance of oomycete inside roots with declining plant species are consistent with oomycete-driven successional change."},

As such uniformly random events alone cannot account for the almost inevitable occurrence of an extremely complex process such as cancer. In the different epistemic realm, an ultimate explanation of cancer is that cancer is a reversion of a cell to an ancestral pre-Metazoan state, i.e. a cellular form of atavism. Several studies have suggested that genes involved in cancer have evolved at particular evolutionary time linked to the unicellular-multicellular transition. Here we used a refined phylostratigraphic analysis of evolutionary ages of the known genes/pathways associated with cancer and the genes differentially expressed between normal and cancer tissue as well as between embryonic and mature (differentiated) cells. We found that cancer-specific transcriptomes and cancer-related pathways were enriched for genes that evolved in the pre-Metazoan era and depleted of genes that evolved in the post-Metazoan era. By contrast an opposite relation was found for cell maturation: the age distribution frequency of the genes expressed in differentiated epithelial cells were enriched for post-Metazoan genes and depleted of pre-Metazoan ones. These findings support the atavism theory that cancer cells manifest the reactivation of an ancient ancestral state featuring unicellular modalities. Thus our bioinformatics analyses suggest that not only does oncogenesis recapitulate ontogenesis, and ontogenesis recapitulates phylogenesis, but also oncogenesis recapitulates phylogenesis. This more encompassing perspective may offer a natural organizing framework for genetic alterations in cancers and point to new treatment options that target the genes controlling the atavism transition."},

The activation of these G-proteins, known as the Rho of Plants (ROPs), by the plant hormone auxin, is known to promote certain protuberances on root hair cells, which are crucial for both anchorage and the uptake of nutrients from the soil. Our mathematical model for the activation of ROPs by the auxin gradient is an extension of the model of Payne and Grierson [PLoS ONE, 12(4), (2009)], and consists of a two-component Schnakenberg-type RD system with spatially heterogeneous coefficients on a 2-D domain. The nonlinear kinetics in this RD system model the nonlinear interactions between the active and inactive forms of ROPs. By using a singular perturbation analysis to study 2-D localized spatial patterns of active ROPs, it is shown that the spatial variations in the nonlinear reaction kinetics, due to the auxin gradient, lead to a slow spatial alignment of the localized regions of active ROPs along the longitudinal midline of the plant cell. Numerical bifurcation analysis, together with time-dependent numerical simulations of the RD system are used to illustrate both 2-D localized patterns in the model, and the spatial alignment of localized structures."},

MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance. Results from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Health's \"Up For A Challenge\" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids via alpha-cyclodextrins (aCD) as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of beta-1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells). Beta-cyclodextrins (bCD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller aCDs also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-aCD to be twice as effective as HPbCD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. If the previous successful animal studies with bCDs are replicated with the safer and more effective aCDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with aCDs are warranted in women with triple-negative breast cancer, who progress fast and have few treatment options."},

LapA of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 is a giant type-1 secreted (T1S) adhesin that facilitates biofilm formation only when displayed at the cell surface. A LapA-targeting periplasmic protease, LapG, connects intracellular cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels with cell surface-associated LapA by cleaving and absolving LapA from the cell surface under conditions unsuitable for biofilm formation. Here, we demonstrate that LapA contains a novel N-terminal element, called the retention module (RM), which prohibits classical one-step T1S of LapA. We provide evidence that the RM of LapA tethers LapA at the cell surface through its outer membrane TolC-like pore, LapE, where LapA is accessible to the periplasmic protease LapG. We also demonstrate that this unusual retention strategy is likely conserved among LapA-like proteins and represents a new subclass of T1SS ABC transporters exclusively involved in transporting LapA-like adhesins."},

However, whether intergenic expression reflects transcriptional noise or activity of novel genes remains unclear. We identified intergenic transcribed regions (ITRs) in 15 diverse flowering plant species and found that the amount of intergenic expression correlates with genome size, a pattern that could be expected if intergenic expression is largely nonfunctional. To further assess the functionality of ITRs, we first built machine learning classifiers using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model that accurately distinguish functional sequences (phenotype genes) and likely nonfunctional ones (pseudogenes and unexpressed intergenic regions) by integrating 93 biochemical, evolutionary, and sequence-structure features. Next, by applying the models genome-wide, we found that 4,427 ITRs (38%) and 796 annotated ncRNAs (44%) had features significantly similar to benchmark protein-coding or RNA genes and thus were likely parts of functional genes. Approximately 60% of ITRs and ncRNAs were more similar to nonfunctional sequences and were likely transcriptional noise. The predictive framework established here provides not only a comprehensive look at how functional, genic sequences are distinct from likely nonfunctional ones, but also a new way to differentiate novel genes from genomic regions with noisy transcriptional activities."},

Here we show that excess DNA methylation-based epigenetic silencing promotes eye degeneration in blind cave Astyanax mexicanus.  By performing parallel analyses in Astyanax mexicanus cave and surface morphs and in the zebrafish Danio rerio, we have discovered that DNA methylation mediates eye-specific gene repression and globally regulates early eye development.  The most significantly hypermethylated and down-regulated genes in the cave morph are also linked to human eye disorders, suggesting the function of these genes is conserved across the vertebrates. Our results show that changes in DNA methylation-based gene repression can serve as an important molecular mechanism generating phenotypic diversity during development and evolution."},

Here, by transfecting the engulfment receptor Draper into Drosophila S2 cells and using PS-coated beads to mimic apoptotic cells, we have created a simplified system for studying this process. We show that ligand-bound Draper forms mobile microclusters that recruit effector proteins and exclude a transmembrane phosphatase, suggesting a kinetic segregation mechanism for receptor activation similar to T cell receptors. Like the TCR, Draper's extracellular domain and ligand can be replaced with other interacting modules. We show that phosphorylation of Draper's ITAM motif occurs first and is a dominant contributor to signaling. After ITAM phosphorylation, additional residues become phosphorylated and contribute to signaling efficiency. Our results demonstrate broad mechanistic similarities between Draper and mammalian immune receptor activation and an ability to reprogram engulfment signaling."},

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to reside and function primarily inside the nucleus, but nuclear localization of protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) has been considered rare in both animals and plants. Here we show that two mRNAs, transcribed from the CDC20 and CCS52B (plant orthologue of CDH1) genes, are specifically sequestered inside the nucleus during the cell cycle. CDC20 and CDH1 both function as coactivators of the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ligase to trigger cyclin B (C YCB) destruction. In the Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristem (SAM), we find CDC20 and CCS52B are co-expressed with CYCBs in mitotic cells. CYCB transcripts can be exported and translated, whereas CDC20 and CCS52B mRNAs are strictly confined to the nucleus at prophase and the cognate proteins are not translated until the redistribution of the mRNAs to the cytoplasm after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) at prometaphase. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) is necessary and sufficient for CDC20 mRNA nuclear localization as well as protein translation. Mitotic enrichment of CDC20 and CCS52B transcripts enables the timely and rapid activation of APC/C, while their nuclear sequestration at prophase appears to protect cyclins from precocious degradation."},

Specifically, we report that greater familial affective responsiveness is associated with heightened amygdala reactivity to interpersonal threat, particularly in adolescents having experienced relatively low recent stress.  These findings extend the literature on the effects of caregiving extremes on brain function to subtle, normative variability, but suggest that presumably protective factors may be associated with increased risk-related amygdala reactivity.  We consider these paradoxical associations with regard to studies of basic associative threat learning and further consider their relevance for understanding potential effects of caregiving on psychological development."},

This pseudotemporal information can be used to characterise transient events in temporally evolving biological systems. Conventional algorithms typically emphasise an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. Here we introduce an orthogonal approach termed \"Ouija\" that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. In the following we introduce our model and demonstrate that in many instances a small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the whole transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify \"metastable\" states - discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories that recapitulate known cell types. Ouija therefore provides a powerful complimentary approach to existing whole transcriptome based pseudotime estimation methods.

Here, we utilize homology modeling techniques to calculate full-length structures of human Hsp90\u03b1 in closed and partially-open conformations. Atomistic simulations of these structures demonstrated that bound ATP stabilizes the dimer by 'tensing' each protomer, while ADP and apo configurations 'relax' the complex by increasing global flexibility. Dynamic residue network analysis revealed regions of the protein involved in intra-protein communication, and identified several overlapping key communication hubs that correlate with known functional sites. Perturbation response scanning analysis identified several potential residue sites capable of modulating conformational change in favour of interstate conversion. For the ATP-bound open conformation, these sites were found to overlap with known Aha1 and client binding sites, demonstrating how naturally occurring forces associated with co-factor binding could allosterically modulate conformational dynamics."},

The full catalog of direct Mek1 phosphorylation targets remains unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 on threonine 11 (H3 T11ph) is induced by meiotic DSBs in S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Molecular genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae confirmed that Mek1 is required for H3 T11ph and revealed that phosphorylation is rapidly reversed when Mek1 kinase is no longer active. Reconstituting histone phosphorylation in vitro with recombinant proteins demonstrated that Mek1 directly catalyzes H3 T11 phosphorylation. Mutating H3 T11 to nonphosphorylatable residues conferred no detectable defects in otherwise unperturbed meiosis, although the mutations modestly reduced spore viability in certain strains where Rad51 is used for strand exchange in place of Dmc1. H3 T11ph is therefore mostly dispensable for Mek1 function. However, H3 T11ph provides an excellent marker of ongoing Mek1 kinase activity in vivo. Anti-H3 T11ph chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing demonstrated that H3 T11ph was highly enriched at presumed sites of attachment of chromatin to chromosome axes, gave a more modest signal along chromatin loops, and was present at still lower levels immediately adjacent to DSB hotspots. These localization patterns closely tracked the distribution of Red1 and Hop1, axis proteins required for Mek1 activation. These findings provide insight into the spatial disposition of Mek1 kinase activity and the higher order organization of recombining meiotic chromosomes."},

As a result, a large variety of experimental and computational strategies have been developed to identify cis-regulatory enhancer sequences. However, in practice, most studies consider enhancer candidates identified by a single method alone. Here we assess the robustness of conclusions based on such a paradigm by comparing enhancer sets identified by different strategies. Because the field currently lacks a comprehensive gold standard, our goal was not to identify the best identification strategy, but rather to quantify the consistency of enhancer sets identified by ten representative identification strategies and to assess the robustness of conclusions based on one approach alone. We found significant dissimilarity between enhancer sets in terms of genomic characteristics, evolutionary conservation, and association with functional loci. This substantial disagreement between enhancer sets within the same biological context is sufficient to influence downstream biological interpretations, and to lead to disparate scientific conclusions about enhancer biology and disease mechanisms. Specifically, we find that different enhancer sets in the same context vary significantly in their overlap with GWAS SNPs and eQTL, and that the majority of GWAS SNPs and eQTL overlap enhancers identified by only a single identification strategy. Furthermore, we find limited evidence that enhancer candidates identified by multiple strategies are more likely to have regulatory function than enhancer candidates identified by a single method. The difficulty of consistently identifying and categorizing enhancers presents a major challenge to mapping the genetic architecture of complex disease, and to interpreting variants found in patient genomes. To facilitate evaluation of the effects of different annotation approaches on studies' conclusions, we developed a database of enhancer annotations in common biological contexts, creDB, which is designed to integrate into bioinformatics workflows. Our results highlight the inherent complexity of enhancer biology and argue that current approaches have yet to adequately account for enhancer diversity."},

Breeding of resistance genes (R gene) into elite crop cultivars has been the standard and most cost-effective practice. However, R gene-mediated resistance is limited by the available R genes within genetic resources and in many cases, by strain specificity. Therefore, it is important to generate new and broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. The CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat, CRISPR-associated) editing system has been employed to confer resistance to human viruses and several plant single-stranded DNA geminiviruses, pointing out the possible application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for virus control. Here we demonstrate that strong viral resistance to cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), a pararetrovirus with a double-stranded DNA genome, can be achieved through Cas9-mediated multiplex targeting of the viral coat protein sequence. We further show that small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are produced and mostly map to the 3' end of guide RNAs (gRNA), although very low levels of siRNAs map to the spacer region as well. However, these siRNAs are not responsible for the inhibited CaMV infection because there is no resistance if Cas9 is not present. We have also observed edited viruses in systematically infected leaves in some transgenic plants, with short deletions or insertions consistent with Cas9-induced DNA breaks at the gRNA target sites in coat protein coding sequence. These edited coat proteins, in most cases, led to earlier translation stop and thus, non-functional coat proteins. We also recovered wild-type CP sequence in these infected transgenic plants, suggesting these edited viral genomes were packaged by wild-type coat proteins. Our data demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used for virus control against plant pararetroviruses with further modifications."},

We recorded ensembles of grid cells in superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex during active exploratory behaviors and overnight sleep. Per pair and collectively, we found preserved patterns of spike-time correlations across waking, REM, and non-REM sleep, which reflected the spatial tuning offsets between these cells during active exploration.

Here we used scalp EEG to test how neural oscillations change during learning of arbitrary visuo-motor associations. Participants learned to associative 48 different abstract shapes to one of four button responses through trial and error over repetitions of the shapes. To quantify how well the associations were learned for each trial, we used a state-space computational model of learning that provided a probability of each trial being correct given past performance for that stimulus, that we take as a measure of the strength of the association. We used linear modelling to relate single-trial neural oscillations to single-trial measures of association strength. We found frontal midline theta oscillations during the delay period tracked learning, where theta activity was strongest during the early stages of learning and declined as the associations were formed. Further, posterior alpha and low-beta oscillations in the cue period showed strong desynchronised activity early in learning, while stronger alpha activity during the delay period were seen as associations became well learned. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects during early learning, before the associations were learned, related to improvements in memory seen on the next presentation of the stimulus.

Here, we estimated the precision of behavioral numerosity discrimination (internal Weber fraction) in twelve adult subjects based on psychophysical testing in a delayed numerosity comparison task outside the scanner. FMRI data were then recorded during a similar task, to obtain the accuracy with which the same sample numerosities could be read out from evoked brain activity patterns, as a measure of the precision of the neuronal representation. Sample numerosities were decodable in both early visual and intraparietal cortex with approximately equal accuracy on average. In parietal cortex, smaller numerosities were better discriminated than larger numerosities of the same ratio, paralleling smaller behavioral Weber fractions for smaller numerosities. Furthermore, in parietal but not early visual cortex, fMRI decoding performance was correlated with behavioral number discrimination acuity across subjects (subjects with a more precise behavioral Weber fraction measured prior to scanning showed greater discriminability of fMRI activity patterns in intraparietal cortex, and more specifically, the right LIP region). These results suggest a crucial role for intraparietal cortex in supporting a numerical representation which is explicitly read out for numerical decisions and behavior."}
